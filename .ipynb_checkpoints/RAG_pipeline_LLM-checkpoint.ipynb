Why then, does the water not flow from blood  plasma to cells? The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.  A concentration gradient is a form of potential energy, like water  172  |  Electrolytes Important for Fluid Balance\",\n          \"Units of Measure  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI\\u2018I AT M\\u0100NOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  In  nutrition,  there  are  two  systems  of  commonly  used  measurements: Metric and US Customary.

The use of dentures or the preparation of  pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also  is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have  a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to  dehydration.  Sensory Issues  At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number.  As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning  that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste.  Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty,  sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less  appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in  sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those  tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes  toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because  the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of  digestive\\u00a0enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.  Dysphagia  Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition  because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to  swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control  swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common  cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia  because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults  suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency.

            "Learning Objectives  By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:  •  Describe basic concepts in nutrition  •  Describe factors that affect your nutritional needs  •  Describe the importance of research and scientific  methods to understanding nutrition  What are Nutrients?  The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances  required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must  be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not  synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three  basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure,  and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic  functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental  surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and  reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body  to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates,  lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain  non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common  in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or  beneficial (such as antioxidants).  4  |  Introduction\n",
            "Macronutrients  Nutrients  that  are  needed  in  large  amounts  are  called  macronutrients. There are three classes of macronutrients:  carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically  processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients  comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is  converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,  allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of  measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels  the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie  multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories,  denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a  capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in  the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other  macronutrients, it does not yield calories.  Carbohydrates  Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and  oxygen. The major food sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk,  fruits, and starchy vegetables, like potatoes. Non-starchy vegetables  also contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities. Carbohydrates  are broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical  structure: simple carbohydrates, often called simple sugars; and  complex carbohydrates.  Simple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units. Examples  of simple sugars include sucrose, the type of sugar you would have  in a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the type of sugar that  circulates in your blood.  Complex carbohydrates are long chains of simple sugars that can  be unbranched or branched. During digestion, the body breaks  Introduction  |  5\n",
            "down digestible complex carbohydrates to simple sugars, mostly  glucose. Glucose is then transported to all our cells where it is  stored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules. Fiber  is also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by  digestive enzymes in the human intestine. As a result, it passes  through the digestive tract undigested unless the bacteria that  inhabit the colon or large intestine break it down.  One gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of  energy for the cells in the body to perform work. In addition to  providing energy and serving as building blocks for bigger  macromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning  of the nervous system, heart, and kidneys. As mentioned, glucose  can be stored in the body for future use. In humans, the storage  molecule of carbohydrates is called glycogen, and in plants, it is  known as starch. Glycogen and starch are complex carbohydrates.  Lipids  Lipids are also a family of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen,  and oxygen, but unlike carbohydrates, they are insoluble in water.  Lipids are found predominantly in butter, oils, meats, dairy  products, nuts, and seeds, and in many processed foods. The three  main  types  of  lipids  are  triglycerides  (triacylglycerols),  phospholipids, and sterols. The main job of lipids is to provide or  store energy. Lipids provide more energy per gram than  carbohydrates (nine kilocalories per gram of lipids versus four  kilocalories per gram of carbohydrates). In addition to energy  storage, lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes,  surround and protect organs (in fat-storing tissues), provide  insulation to aid in temperature regulation, and regulate many other  functions in the body.  6  |  Introduction\n",
            "Figure 1.1 The  Macronutrie nts:  Carbohydrat es, Lipids,  Protein, and  Water  Proteins  Proteins are macromolecules composed of chains of subunits called  amino acids. Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon,  oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include  meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant- based foods, most notably soy. The word protein comes from a  Greek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt  description of these macronutrients; they are also known  colloquially as the “workhorses” of life. Proteins provide four  kilocalories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not  protein’s most important function. Proteins provide structure to  bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the  chemical reactions that take place in the body. Scientists estimate  that greater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist  within the human body. The genetic codes in DNA are basically  protein recipes that determine the order in which 20 different  amino acids are bound together to make thousands of specific  proteins.  Figure 1.1 The Macronutrients: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Protein, and  Water  Introduction  |  7\n",
            "Water  There is one other nutrient that we must have in large quantities:  water. Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two  hydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water. More than 60  percent of your total body weight is water. Without it, nothing could  be transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not  occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would  fluctuate widely. On average, an adult consumes just over two liters  of water per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so  critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and  output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in  Chapter 4.  Micronutrients  Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser  amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions.  Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins.  There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See  Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2  “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their  major functions). In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins,  micronutrients are not sources of energy (calories), but they assist  in the process as cofactors or components of enzymes (i.e.,  coenzymes). Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions  in the body and are involved in all aspects of body functions from  producing  energy,  to  digesting  nutrients,  to  building  macromolecules. Micronutrients play many essential roles in the  body.  Table 1.1 Minerals and Their Major Functions  8  |  Introduction\n",

Vitamins  The thirteen vitamins are categorized as either water-soluble or  fat-soluble. The water-soluble vitamins are vitamin C and all the  B vitamins, which include thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic  acid, pyridoxine, biotin, folate and cobalamin. The fat-soluble  vitamins are A, D, E, and K. Vitamins are required to perform many  functions in the body such as making red blood cells, synthesizing  bone tissue, and playing a role in normal vision, nervous system  function, and immune system function.

For example, a deficiency in niacin causes a disease called  pellagra, which was common in the early twentieth century in some  parts of America. The common signs and symptoms of pellagra  are known as the “4D’s—diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death.”  Until scientists found out that better diets relieved the signs and  symptoms of pellagra, many people with the disease ended up  hospitalized in insane asylums awaiting death. Other vitamins were  also found to prevent certain disorders and diseases such as scurvy  (vitamin C), night blindness vitamin A, and rickets (vitamin D).

One facet of lifestyle is your  dietary habits. Recall that we discussed briefly how nutrition affects  health. A greater discussion of this will follow in subsequent  chapters in this book, as there is an enormous amount of  information regarding this aspect of lifestyle. Dietary habits include  what a person eats, how much a person eats during a meal, how  frequently meals are consumed, and how often a person eats out.  Other aspects of lifestyle include physical activity level, recreational  drug use, and sleeping patterns, all of which play a role in health and  impact nutrition. Following a healthy lifestyle improves your overall  health.  Lifestyles and Nutrition  |  21\n",
            "Physical Activity  In 2008, the Health and Human Services (HHS) released the Physical  Activity Guidelines for Americans1. The HHS states that “Being  physically active is one of the most important steps that Americans  of all ages can take to improve their health. The 2008 Physical  Activity Guidelines for Americans provides science-based guidance  to help Americans aged six and older improve their health through  appropriate physical activity.” The guidelines recommend exercise  programs for people in many different stages of their lifecycle. The  HHS reports that there is strong evidence that increased physical  activity decreases the risk of early death, heart disease, stroke,  Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain cancers; prevents  weight gain and falls; and improves cognitive function in the elderly.  These guidelines are scheduled for an update in 2018. Also unveiled  recently are the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines, which are  available at the website of The Canadian Society for Exercise  Physiology2.  Recreational Drug Use  Recreational drug use, which includes tobacco-smoking, electronic  smoking device use, and alcohol consumption along with narcotic  and other illegal drug use, has a large impact on health.

In the United States,  smoking causes more than four hundred thousand deaths every  single year, which is far more than deaths associated with any other  lifestyle component3.  Also, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC), excessive alcohol intake causes an estimated seventy-five  thousand deaths per year4. Staying away from excessive alcohol  intake lowers blood pressure, the risk from injury, heart disease,  stroke, liver problems, and some types of cancer. While excessive  alcohol consumption can be linked to poor health, consuming  alcohol in moderation has been found to promote health such as  reducing the risk for heart disease and Type 2 diabetes in some  people. The United States Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) defines drinking in moderation as no more than one  drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men5.

Sleeping Patterns  Inadequate amounts of sleep, or not sleeping well, can also have  remarkable effects on a person’s health. In fact, sleeping can affect  your health just as much as your diet. Scientific studies have shown  that insufficient sleep increases the risk for heart disease, Type 2  diabetes, obesity, and depression. Abnormal breathing during sleep,  a condition called sleep apnea, is also linked to an increased risk for  chronic disease7.  Personal Choice: The Challenge of Choosing  Foods  There are other factors besides environment and lifestyle that  influence the foods you choose to eat. Different foods affect energy  level, mood, how much is eaten, how long before you eat again, and  if cravings are satisfied. We have talked about some of the physical  effects of food on your body, but there are other effects too.  Food regulates your appetite and how you feel.

            "have demonstrated that some high fiber foods and high-protein  foods decrease appetite by slowing the digestive process and  prolonging the feeling of being full or satiety. The effects of  individual foods and nutrients on mood are not backed by  consistent scientific evidence, but in general, most studies support  that healthier diets are associated with a decrease in depression and  improved well-being. To date, science has not been able to track the  exact path in the brain that occurs in response to eating a particular  food, but it is quite clear that foods, in general, stimulate emotional  responses in people. Food also has psychological, cultural, and  religious significance, so your personal choices of food affect your  mind, as well as your body. The social implications of food have a  great deal to do with what people eat, as well as how and when.  Special events in individual lives—from birthdays to funerals—are  commemorated with equally special foods. Being aware of these  forces can help people make healthier food choices—and still honor  the traditions and ties they hold dear.  Typically, eating kosher food means a person is Jewish; eating  fish on Fridays during Lent means a person is Catholic; fasting  during the ninth month of the Islamic calendar means a person  is Muslim. On New Year’s Day, Japanese take part in an annual  tradition of Mochitsuki also known as Mochi pounding in hopes  of gaining good fortune over the coming year. Several hundred  miles away in Hawai‘i, people eat poi made from pounded taro root  with great significance in the Hawaiian culture, as it represents  Hāloa, the ancestor of chiefs and kanaka maoli (Native Hawaiians).  National food traditions are carried to other countries when people  immigrate. The local cuisine in Hawai‘i would not be what it is  today without the contributions of Japanese, Chinese, European,  and other immigrant communities.  Lifestyles and Nutrition  |  25\n",
            "Factors that Drive Food Choices  Along with these influences, a number of other factors affect the  dietary choices individuals make, including:  • Taste, texture, and appearance. Individuals have a wide range  of tastes which influence their food choices, leading some to  dislike milk and others to hate raw vegetables. Some foods that  are very healthy, such as tofu, may be unappealing at first to  many people. However, creative cooks can adapt healthy foods  to meet most people’s taste.  • Economics. Access to fresh fruits and vegetables may be scant,  particularly for those who live in economically disadvantaged  or remote areas, where cheaper food options are limited to  convenience stores and fast food.  • Early food experiences. People who were not exposed to  different foods as children, or who were forced to swallow  every last bite of overcooked vegetables, may make limited  food choices as adults.  • Habits. It’s common to establish eating routines, which can  work both for and against optimal health. Habitually grabbing a  fast food sandwich for breakfast can seem convenient, but  might not offer substantial nutrition. Yet getting in the habit of  drinking an ample amount of water each day can yield multiple  benefits.  • Culture. The culture in which one grows up affects how one  sees food in daily life and on special occasions.  • Geography. Where a person lives influences food choices. For  instance, people who live in Midwestern US states have less  access to seafood than those living along the coasts.  • Advertising. The media greatly influences food choice by  persuading consumers to eat certain foods.  • Social factors. Any school lunchroom observer can testify to  the impact of peer pressure on eating habits, and this  26  |  Lifestyles and Nutrition\n",
            "influence lasts through adulthood. People make food choices  based on how they see others and want others to see them. For  example, individuals who are surrounded by others who  consume fast food are more likely to do the same.  • Health concerns. Some people have significant food allergies,  to peanuts for example, and need to avoid those foods. Others  may have developed health issues which require them to follow  a low salt diet. In addition, people who have never worried  about their weight have a very different approach to eating  than those who have long struggled with excess weight.  • Emotions. There is a wide range in how emotional issues affect  eating habits. When faced with a great deal of stress, some  people tend to overeat, while others find it hard to eat at all.  • Green food/Sustainability choices. Based on a growing  understanding of diet as a public and personal issue, more and  more people are starting to make food choices based on their  environmental impact. Realizing that their food choices help  shape the world, many individuals are opting for a vegetarian  diet, or, if they do eat animal products, striving to find the  most “cruelty-free” options possible. Purchasing local and  organic food products and items grown through sustainable  processes also helps shrink the size of one’s dietary footprint.  People choose a vegetarian diet for various reasons, including  religious doctrines, health concerns, ecological and animal welfare  concerns, or simply because they dislike the taste of meat. There  are different types of vegetarians, but a common theme is that  vegetarians do not eat meat. Four common forms of vegetarianism  are:  1. Lacto-ovo vegetarian. This is the most common form. This  type of vegetarian diet includes the animal foods eggs and  dairy products.  2. Lacto-vegetarian. This type of vegetarian diet includes dairy  products but not eggs.

            "Achieving a Healthy Diet  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Achieving a healthy diet is a matter of balancing the quality and  quantity of food that is eaten. There are five key factors that make  up a healthful diet:  1. A diet must be adequate, by providing sufficient amounts of  each essential nutrient, as well as fiber and adequate calories.  2. A balanced diet results when you do not consume one nutrient  at the expense of another, but rather get appropriate amounts  of all nutrients.  3. Calorie control is necessary so that the amount of energy you  get from the nutrients you consume equals the amount of  energy you expend during your day’s activities.  4. Moderation means not eating to the extremes, neither too  much nor too little.  5. Variety refers to consuming different foods from within each  of the food groups on a regular basis.  A healthy diet is one that favors whole foods. As an alternative  to modern processed foods, a healthy diet focuses on “real” fresh  whole foods that have been sustaining people for generations.  Whole foods supply the needed vitamins, minerals, protein,  carbohydrates, fats, and fiber that are essential to good health.  Commercially prepared and fast foods are often lacking nutrients  and often contain inordinate amounts of sugar, salt, saturated and  trans fats, all of which are associated with the development of  diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, cancer,  obesity, diabetes, and other illnesses. A balanced diet is a mix of food  from the different food groups (vegetables, legumes, fruits, grains,  protein foods, and dairy).  30  |  Achieving a Healthy Diet\n",
            "Adequacy  An adequate diet is one that favors nutrient-dense foods. Nutrient- dense foods are defined as foods that contain many essential  nutrients per calorie. Nutrient-dense foods are the opposite of  “empty-calorie” foods, such as sugary carbonated beverages, which  are also called “nutrient-poor.” Nutrient-dense foods include fruits  and vegetables, lean meats, poultry, fish, low-fat dairy products, and  whole grains. Choosing more nutrient-dense foods will facilitate  weight loss, while simultaneously providing all necessary nutrients.  Balance  Balance the foods in your diet. Achieving balance in your diet entails  not consuming one nutrient at the expense of another. For example,  calcium is essential for healthy teeth and bones, but too much  calcium will interfere with iron absorption. Most foods that are  good sources of iron are poor sources of calcium, so in order to  get the necessary amounts of calcium and iron from your diet, a  proper balance between food choices is critical. Another example  is that while sodium is an essential nutrient, excessive intake may  contribute to congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease  in some people. Remember, everything must be consumed in the  proper amounts.  Moderation  Eat in moderation. Moderation is crucial for optimal health and  survival. Eating nutrient-poor foods each night for dinner will lead  to health complications. But as part of an otherwise healthful diet  and consumed only on a weekly basis, this should not significantly  Achieving a Healthy Diet  |  31\n",
            "impact overall health. It’s important to remember that eating is, in  part, about enjoyment and indulging with a spirit of moderation.  This fits within a healthy diet.  Monitor food portions. For optimum weight maintenance, it is  important to ensure that energy consumed from foods meets the  energy expenditures required for body functions and activity. If not,  the excess energy contributes to gradual, steady accumulation of  stored body fat and weight gain. In order to lose body fat, you need  to ensure that more calories are burned than consumed. Likewise,  in order to gain weight, calories must be eaten in excess of what is  expended daily.  Variety  Variety involves eating different foods from all the food groups.  Eating a varied diet helps to ensure that you consume and absorb  adequate amounts of all essential nutrients required for health. One  of the major drawbacks of a monotonous diet is the risk of  consuming too much of some nutrients and not enough of others.  Trying new foods can also be a source of pleasure—you never know  what foods you might like until you try them.  Developing a healthful diet can be rewarding, but be mindful that  all of the principles presented must be followed to derive maximal  health benefits. For instance, introducing variety in your diet can  still result in the consumption of too many high-calorie, nutrient  poor foods and inadequate nutrient intake if you do not also employ  moderation and calorie control. Using all of these principles  together will promote lasting health benefits.  32  |  Achieving a Healthy Diet\n",

Once observations are  made, they come up with a hypothesis, test their hypothesis, and  then interpret the results. After this, they gather additional evidence  from multiple sources and finally come up with a conclusion. This  organized process of inquiry used in science is called the scientific  method.  34  |  Research and the Scientific Method\n",
            "Scientific  Method steps  Figure 1.2 Scientific Method Steps  In 1811, French chemist Bernard Courtois was isolating saltpeter for  producing gunpowder to be used by Napoleon’s army. To carry out  this isolation, he burned some seaweed and in the process, observed  an intense violet vapor that crystallized when he exposed it to a cold  surface. He sent the violet crystals to an expert on gases, Joseph  Gay-Lussac, who identified the crystal as a new element. It was  named iodine, the Greek word for violet. The following scientific  record is some of what took place in order to conclude that iodine  is a nutrient.  Observation. Eating seaweed is a cure for goiter, a gross  enlargement of the thyroid gland in the neck.  Hypothesis. In 1813, Swiss physician Jean-Francois Coindet  hypothesized that the seaweed contained iodine, and that iodine  could be used instead of seaweed to treat his patients1.  1. Zimmerman, M.B. (2008). Research on Iodine Deficiency  and Goiter in the 19th and Early 20th Centuries. Journal  Research and the Scientific Method  |  35\n",
            "Experimental test. Coindet administered iodine tincture orally to  his patients with goiter.  Interpret results. Coindet’s iodine treatment was successful.    Hypothesis. French chemist Chatin proposed that the low iodine  content in food and water in certain areas far away from the ocean  was the primary cause of goiter, and renounced the theory that  goiter was the result of poor hygiene.  Experimental test. In the late 1860s the program, “The stamping- out of goiter,” started with people in several villages in France being  given iodine tablets.  Results. The program was effective and 80 percent of goitrous  children were cured.    Hypothesis. In 1918, Swiss doctor Bayard proposed iodizing salt as  a good way to treat areas endemic with goiter.  Experimental test. Iodized salt was transported by mules to a  small village at the base of the Matterhorn where more than 75  percent of school children were goitrous. It was given to families to  use for six months.  Results. The iodized salt was beneficial in treating goiter in this  remote population.    Experimental test. Physician David Marine conducted the first  experiment of treating goiter with iodized salt in America in Akron,  Ohio.2  of Nutrition, 138(11), 2060–63. http:/ /jn.nutrition.org/ content/138/11/2060.full  2. Carpenter, K.J.

            "Results. This study was conducted on over four-thousand school  children, and found that iodized salt prevented goiter.  Conclusions. Seven other studies similar to Marine’s were  conducted in Italy and Switzerland, which also demonstrated the  effectiveness of iodized salt in treating goiter. In 1924, US public  health officials initiated the program of iodizing salt and started  eliminating the scourge of goiter. Today, more than 70% of American  households use iodized salt and many other countries have followed  the same public health strategy to reduce the health consequences  of iodine deficiency.  Career Connection  What are some of the ways in which you think like a  scientist, and use the scientific method in your everyday  life? Any decision-making process uses some aspect of the  scientific method. Think about some of the major decisions  you have made in your life and the research you conducted  that supported your decision. For example, what brand of  computer do you own? Where is your money invested?  What college do you attend?  Evidence-Based Approach to Nutrition  It took more than one hundred years from iodine’s discovery as  an effective treatment for goiter until public health programs  recognized it as such. Although a lengthy process, the scientific  method is a productive way to define essential nutrients and  determine their ability to promote health and prevent disease.

            "scientific method is part of the overall evidence-based approach to  designing nutritional guidelines3. An evidence-based approach to  nutrition includes4:  • Defining the problem or uncertainty (e.g., the incidence of  goiter is lower in people who consume seaweed)  • Formulating it as a question (e.g., Does eating seaweed  decrease the risk of goiter?)  • Setting criteria for quality evidence  • Evaluating the body of evidence  • Summarizing the body of evidence and making decisions  • Specifying the strength of the supporting evidence required to  make decisions  • Disseminating the findings  The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, a  nonprofit, non-governmental organization, constructs its nutrient  recommendations (i.e., Dietary Reference Intakes, or DRI) using an  evidence-based approach to nutrition.

Unfortunately, not all scientific conclusions are developed in the  interest of human health, and some can be biased. Therefore, it is  important to know where a scientific study was conducted and who  provided the funding, as this can have an impact on the scientific  conclusions being made.

Nutritional Science Evolution  One of the newest areas in the realm of nutritional science is the  scientific  discipline  of  nutritional  genetics,  also  called  nutrigenomics.

While we know that health is defined as more than  just the absence of disease, there are currently very few accurate  genetic markers of good health. Rather, there are many more  genetic markers for disease. However, science is evolving, and  nutritional genetics aims to identify what nutrients to eat to “turn  on” healthy genes and “turn off” genes that cause disease.  Using Science and Technology to Change the  Future  As science evolves, so does technology. Both can be used to create a  healthy diet, optimize health, and prevent disease.

What else is not  far off? How about another app that provides a shopping list that  adheres to all dietary guidelines and is emailed to the central server  at your local grocer, who then delivers the food to your home? The  food is then stored in your smart fridge which documents your  daily diet at home and delivers your weekly dietary assessment to  your home computer. At your computer, you can compare your diet  with other diets aimed at weight loss, optimal strength training,  reduction in risk for specific diseases or any other health goals you  may have. You also may delve into the field of nutritional genetics  and download your gene expression profiles to a database that  analyzes your genes against millions of others.  Nutrition and the Media  A motivational speaker once said, “A smart person believes half of  what they read. An intelligent person knows which half to believe.”  In this age of information, where instant Internet access is just a  click away, it is easy to be misled if you do not know where to go for  reliable nutrition information.  Using Eyes of Discernment  “New study shows that margarine contributes to arterial plaque.”  “Asian study reveals that two cups of coffee per day can have  detrimental effects on the nervous system.”  How do you react when you read news of this nature? Do you  boycott margarine and coffee? When reading nutrition-related  48  |  Types of Scientific Studies\n",
            "claims, articles, websites, or advertisements, always remember that  one study does not substantiate a fact. One study neither proves  nor disproves anything. Readers who may be looking for complex  answers to nutritional dilemmas can quickly misconstrue such  statements and be led down a path of misinformation. Listed below  are ways that you can develop discerning eyes when reading  nutritional news.  1. The scientific study under discussion should be published in a  peer reviewed journal, such as the Journal of Nutrition.  Question studies that come from less trustworthy sources  (such as non peer-reviewed journals or websites) or that are  not formally published.  2. The report should disclose the methods used by the  researcher(s). Did the study last for three or thirty weeks?  Were there ten or one hundred participants? What did the  participants actually do? Did the researcher(s) observe the  results themselves or did they rely on self reports from  program participants?  3. Who were the subjects of this study? Humans or animals? If  human, are any traits/characteristics noted? You may realize  you have more in common with certain program participants  and can use that as a basis to gauge if the study applies to you.  4. Credible reports often disseminate new findings in the context  of previous research. A single study on its own gives you very  limited information, but if a body of literature supports a  finding, it adds to credibility.  5. Peer-reviewed articles deliver a broad perspective and are  inclusive of findings of many studies on the exact same subject.  6. When reading such news, ask yourself, “Is this making sense?”  Even if coffee does adversely affect the nervous system, do you  drink enough of it to see any negative effects? Remember, if a  headline professes a new remedy for a nutrition-related topic,  it may well be a research-supported piece of news, but more  often than not, it is a sensational story designed to catch the  Types of Scientific Studies  |  49\n",

Around the world, other cultures had  similar views of food and its relationship with health. A famous  quote by the Greek physician Hippocrates over two thousand years  ago, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food” bear much  relevance on our food choices and their connection to our health.  Today, the scientific community echoes Hippocrates’ statement as  it recognizes some foods as functional foods. The Academy of  Nutrition and Dietetics defines functional foods as “whole foods  and fortified, enriched, or enhanced foods that have a potentially  beneficial effect on health when consumed as part of a varied diet  on a regular basis, at effective levels.”  In the latter nineteenth century, a Russian doctor of immunology,  Elie Metchnikoff, was intrigued by the healthy life spans of people  who lived in the tribes of the northern Caucasus Mountains. What  contributed to their long lifespan and their resistance to life- threatening diseases? A possible factor lay wrapped up in a leather  satchel used to hold fermented milk. Observing the connection  between the beverage and longevity, Dr. Elie Metchnikoff began his  research on beneficial bacteria and the longevity of life that led to  his book, The Prolongation of Life. He studied the biological effects  and chemical properties of the kefir elixir whose name came from  the Turkish word “kef” or “pleasure.” To this day, kefir is one of the  most widely enjoyed beverages in Russia.  Kefir has since found its way into America, where it is marketed in  56  |  Introduction\n",

It is one  product of the billion-dollar functional food industry marketed with  all sorts of health claims from improving digestion to preventing  cancer. What is the scientific evidence that kefir is a functional  food? Expert nutritionists agree that probiotics, such as kefir,  reduce the symptoms of lactose intolerance and can ward off virally  caused diarrhea. While some health claims remain unsubstantiated,  scientific studies are ongoing to determine the validity of other  health benefits of probiotics.  The Native Hawaiians also consumed a daily probiotic in their  diet commonly known as poi (pounded taro). In precolonial Hawai‘i,  poi was used for a wide variety of dietary and medicinal purposes.  Aside from poi’s nutrient dense composition, fermented poi has  numerous compounds created in the fermentation process that are  very beneficial to the health of the human body. As a probiotic,  evidence suggests that poi can be useful in helping diseases such  as diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory  bowel disease, and cancer.1  Another well-known probiotic to the local people of Hawai‘i is  Kimchi. Kimchi is a traditional Korean food that is manufactured by  fermenting vegetables (usually cabbage). Similar to the kefir and poi,  kimchi also has shown to have similar health benefits as a probiotic  food.2  The Japanese also have traditional fermented foods such as natto.

A  living organism conducts self-sustaining biological processes. A cell  is the smallest and most basic form of life.  The cell theory incorporates three principles:  Cells are the most basic building units of life. All living things  are composed of cells. New cells are made from preexisting cells,  which divide in two. Who you are has been determined because  of two cells that came together inside your mother’s womb. The  two cells containing all of your genetic information (DNA) united to  begin making new life. Cells divided and differentiated into other  cells with specific roles that led to the formation of the body’s  numerous body organs, systems, blood, blood vessels, bone, tissue,  and skin. As an adult, you are made up of trillions of cells. Each of  your individual cells is a compact and efficient form of life—self- sufficient, yet interdependent upon the other cells within your body  to supply its needs.  Independent single-celled organisms must conduct all the basic  processes of life. The single-celled organism must take in nutrients  (energy capture), excrete wastes, detect and respond to its  environment, move, breathe, grow, and reproduce. Even a one- celled organism must be organized to perform these essential  processes. All cells are organized from the atomic level to all its  larger forms.

The carbon atom is often referred to as the  backbone of life because it can readily bond with four other  elements to form long chains and more complex macromolecules.  Four macromolecules—carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic  acids—make up all of the structural and functional units of cells.  Although we defined the cell as the “most basic” unit of life,  it is structurally and functionally complex (Figure 2.2 “The Cell  Structure”). A cell can be thought of as a mini-organism consisting  of tiny organs called organelles. The organelles are structural and  functional units constructed from several macromolecules bonded  together. A typical animal cell contains the following organelles:  the nucleus (which houses the genetic material DNA), mitochondria  (which generate energy), ribosomes (which produce protein), the  endoplasmic reticulum (which is a packaging and transport facility),  and the golgi apparatus (which distributes macromolecules). In  addition, animal cells contain little digestive pouches, called  lysosomes and peroxisomes, which break down macromolecules  and destroy foreign invaders. All of the organelles are anchored  in the cell’s cytoplasm via a cytoskeleton. The cell’s organelles are  isolated from the surrounding environment by a plasma membrane.

            "The Digestive System  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  The process of digestion begins even before you put food into your  mouth. When you feel hungry, your body sends a message to your  brain that it is time to eat. Sights and smells influence your body’s  preparedness for food. Smelling food sends a message to your brain.  Your brain then tells the mouth to get ready, and you start to  salivate in preparation for a meal.  Once you have eaten, your digestive system (Figure 2.4 “The  Human Digestive System”) starts the process that breaks down the  components of food into smaller components that can be absorbed  and taken into the body. To do this, the digestive system functions  on two levels, mechanically to move and mix ingested food and  chemically to break down large molecules. The smaller nutrient  molecules can then be absorbed and processed by cells throughout  the body for energy  or used as building blocks for new cells. The  digestive system is one of the eleven organ systems of the human  body, and it is composed of several hollow tube-shaped organs  including the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine,  large intestine (colon), rectum, and anus. It is lined with mucosal  tissue that secretes digestive juices (which aid in the breakdown of  food) and mucus (which facilitates the propulsion of food through  the tract). Smooth muscle tissue surrounds the digestive tract and  its contraction produces waves, known as peristalsis, that propel  food down the tract. Nutrients, as well as some non-nutrients, are  absorbed. Substances such as fiber get left behind and are  appropriately excreted.

The World Health  Organization defines probiotics as live bacteria that confer  beneficial health effects on their host. They are sometimes  called “friendly bacteria.” The most common bacteria  labeled as probiotic is lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli). They  are added as live cultures to certain fermented foods such  as yogurt. Prebiotics are indigestible foods, primarily  soluble fibers, that stimulate the growth of certain strains  of bacteria in the large intestine and provide health benefits  to the host.

            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  From the Mouth to the Stomach  There are four steps in the digestion process (Figure 2.5 “The  Human Digestive System”). The first step is ingestion, which is the  intake of food into the digestive tract. It may seem a simple process,  but ingestion involves smelling food, thinking about food, and the  involuntary release of saliva in the mouth to prepare for food entry.  In the mouth, where the second step of digestion starts, the  mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins. The chemical  breakdown of food involves enzymes, such as salivary amylase that  starts the breakdown of large starch molecules into smaller  components.  Mechanical breakdown starts with mastication (chewing) in the  mouth. Teeth crush and grind large food particles, while saliva  provides lubrication and enables food movement downward. The  slippery mass of partially broken-down food is called a bolus, which  moves down the digestive tract as you swallow. Swallowing may  seem voluntary at first because it requires conscious effort to push  the food with the tongue back toward the throat, but after this,  swallowing proceeds involuntarily, meaning it cannot be stopped  72  |  The Digestive System\n",
            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  once it begins. As you swallow, the bolus is pushed from the mouth  through the pharynx and into a muscular tube called the esophagus.  As the bolus travels through the pharynx, a small flap called the  epiglottis closes to prevent choking by keeping food from going  into the trachea. Peristaltic contractions also known as peristalsis in  the esophagus propel the food bolus down to the stomach (Figure  3.6 “Peristalsis in the Esophagus”). At the junction between the  esophagus and stomach there is a sphincter muscle that remains  closed until the food bolus approaches. The pressure of the food  bolus stimulates the lower esophageal sphincter to relax and open  and food then moves from the esophagus into the stomach. The  mechanical breakdown of food is accentuated by the muscular  contractions of the stomach and small intestine that mash, mix,  slosh, and propel food down the alimentary canal. Solid food takes  between four and eight seconds to travel down the esophagus, and  liquids take about one second.  Figure 2.6 Peristalsis in the Esophagus  The Digestive System  |  73\n",
            "From the Stomach to the Small Intestine  When food enters the stomach, a highly muscular organ, powerful  peristaltic contractions help mash, pulverize, and churn food into  chyme. Chyme is a semiliquid mass of partially digested food that  also contains gastric juices secreted by cells in the stomach. These  gastric juices contain hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin, that  chemically start breakdown of the protein components of food.  The length of time food spends in the stomach varies by the  macronutrient composition of the meal. A high-fat or high-protein  meal takes longer to break down than one rich in carbohydrates.  It usually takes a few hours after a meal to empty the stomach  contents completely into the small intestine.  The small intestine is divided into three structural parts: the  duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Once the chyme enters the  duodenum (the first segment of the small intestine), the pancreas  and gallbladder are stimulated and release juices that aid in  digestion. The pancreas secretes up to 1.5 liters (.4 US gallons) of  pancreatic juice through a duct into the duodenum per day. This  fluid consists mostly of water, but it also contains bicarbonate ions  that neutralize the acidity of the stomach-derived chyme and  enzymes that further break down proteins, carbohydrates, and  lipids. The gallbladder secretes a much smaller amount of a fluid  called bile that helps to digest fats. Bile passes through a duct that  joins the pancreatic ducts and is released into the duodenum. Bile  is made in the liver and stored in the gall bladder. Bile’s components  act like detergents by surrounding fats similar to the way dish soap  removes grease from a frying pan. This allows for the movement of  fats in the watery environment of the small intestine. Two different  types of muscular contractions, called peristalsis and segmentation,  control the movement and mixing of the food in various stages of  digestion through the small intestine.  Similar to what occurs in the esophagus and stomach, peristalsis  is circular waves of smooth muscle contraction that propel food  74  |  The Digestive System\n",
            "“Segmentatio n” by  OpenStax  College / CC  BY 3.0  forward. Segmentation from circular muscle contraction slows  movement in the small intestine by forming temporary “sausage  link” type of segments that allows chyme to slosh food back and  forth in both directions to promote mixing of the chyme and  enhance absorption of nutrients (Figure 2.7 “Segmentation”). Almost  all the components of food are completely broken down to their  simplest units within the first 25 centimeters of the small intestine.  Instead of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, the chyme now  consists of amino acids, monosaccharides, and emulsified  components of triglycerides.  Figure 2.7 Segmentation  The third step of digestion (nutrient absorption) takes place mainly  in the remaining length of the small intestine, or ileum (> 5 meters).  The way the small intestine is structured gives it a huge surface  The Digestive System  |  75\n",
            "“Histology  Small  Intestines” by  OpenStax  College / CC  BY 3.0  area to maximize nutrient absorption. The surface area is increased  by folds, villi, and microvilli. Digested nutrients are absorbed into  either capillaries or lymphatic vessels contained within each  microvillus.  The small intestine is perfectly structured for maximizing  nutrient absorption. Its surface area is greater than 200 square  meters, which is about the size of a tennis court. The large surface  area is due to the multiple levels of folding. The internal tissue  of the small intestine is covered in villi, which are tiny finger-like  projections that are covered with even smaller projections, called  microvilli (Figure 2.8 “Structure of the Small Intestine”). The  digested nutrients pass through the absorptive cells of the intestine  via diffusion or special transport proteins. Amino acids, short fatty  acids, and monosaccharides (sugars) are transported from the  intestinal cells into capillaries, but the larger fatty acids, fat-soluble  vitamins, and other lipids are transported first through lymphatic  vessels, which soon meet up with blood vessels.  Figure 2.8 Structure of the Small Intestine  76  |  The Digestive System\n",
            "From the Small Intestine to the Large Intestine  The process of digestion is fairly efficient. Any food that is still  incompletely broken down (usually less than ten percent of food  consumed) and the food’s indigestible fiber content move from the  small intestine to the large intestine (colon) through a connecting  valve. A main task of the large intestine is to absorb much of the  remaining water. Remember, water is present not only in solid foods  and beverages, but also the stomach releases a few hundred  milliliters of gastric juice, and the pancreas adds approximately 500  milliliters during the digestion of the meal. For the body to conserve  water, it is important that excessive water is not lost in fecal matter.  In the large intestine, no further chemical or mechanical breakdown  of food takes place unless it is accomplished by the bacteria that  inhabit this portion of the intestinal tract. The number of bacteria  residing in the large intestine is estimated to be greater than 1014,  which is more than the total number of cells in the human body  (1013). This may seem rather unpleasant, but the great majority  of bacteria in the large intestine are harmless and many are even  beneficial.  From the Large Intestine to the Anus  After a few hours in the stomach, plus three to six hours in the  small intestine, and about sixteen hours in the large intestine, the  digestion process enters step four, which is the elimination of  indigestible food matter as feces. Feces contain indigestible food  components and gut bacteria (almost 50 percent of content). It  is stored in the rectum until it is expelled through the anus via  defecation.  The Digestive System  |  77\n",
            "Nutrients Are Essential for Cell and Organ  Function  When the digestive system has broken down food to its nutrient  components, the body eagerly awaits delivery. Water soluble  nutrients absorbed into the blood travel directly to the liver via a  major blood vessel called the portal vein. One of the liver’s primary  functions is to regulate metabolic homeostasis. Metabolic  homeostasis is achieved when the nutrients consumed and  absorbed match the energy required to carry out life’s biological  processes. Simply put, nutrient energy intake equals energy output.  Whereas glucose and amino acids are directly transported from  the small intestine to the liver, lipids are transported to the liver  by a more circuitous route involving the lymphatic system. The  lymphatic system is a one-way system of vessels that transports  lymph, a fluid rich in white blood cells, and lipid soluble substances  after a meal containing lipids. The lymphatic system slowly moves  its contents through the lymphatic vessels and empties into blood  vessels in the upper chest area. Now, the absorbed lipid soluble  components are in the blood where they can be distributed  throughout the body and utilized by cells (see Figure 2.9 “The  Absorption of Nutrients”).

            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  Maintaining the body’s energy status quo is crucial because when  metabolic homeostasis is disturbed by an eating disorder or disease,  bodily function suffers. This will be discussed in more depth in the  last section of this chapter. The liver is the only organ in the human  body that is capable of exporting nutrients for energy production to  other tissues. Therefore, when a person is in between meals (fasted  state) the liver exports nutrients, and when a person has just eaten  (fed state) the liver stores nutrients within itself. Nutrient levels  and the hormones that respond to their levels in the blood provide  the input so that the liver can distinguish between the fasted and  fed states and distribute nutrients appropriately. Although not  considered to be an organ, adipose tissue stores fat in the fed state  and mobilizes fat components to supply energy to other parts of the  body when energy is needed.

            "All eleven organ systems in the human body require nutrient input  to perform their specific biological functions. Overall health and the  ability to carry out all of life’s basic processes is fueled by energy- supplying nutrients (carbohydrate, fat, and protein). Without them,  organ systems would fail, humans would not reproduce, and the  race would disappear.

            "“Blood Flow  Through the  Heart” by  OpenStax  College / CC  BY 3.0  The cardiovascular system is one of the eleven organ systems of  the human body. Its main function is to transport nutrients to cells  and wastes from cells (Figure 2.12 “Cardiovascular Transportation  of Nutrients”). This system consists of the heart, blood, and blood  vessels. The heart pumps the blood, and the blood is the  transportation fluid. The transportation route to all tissues, a highly  intricate blood-vessel network, comprises arteries, veins, and  capillaries. Nutrients absorbed in the small intestine travel mainly to  the liver through the hepatic portal vein. From the liver, nutrients  travel upward through the inferior vena cava blood vessel to the  heart. The heart forcefully pumps the nutrient-rich blood first to  the lungs to pick up some oxygen and then to all other cells in  the body. Arteries become smaller and smaller on their way to  cells, so that by the time blood reaches a cell, the artery’s diameter  is extremely small and the vessel is now called a capillary. The  reduced diameter of the blood vessel substantially slows the speed  of blood flow. This dramatic reduction in blood flow gives cells time  to harvest the nutrients in blood and exchange metabolic wastes.  Figure 2.11 The Blood Flow in the Cardiovascular System  84  |  The Cardiovascular System\n",
            "Blood’s Function in the Body and in Metabolism  Support  You know you cannot live without blood, and that your heart pumps  your blood over a vast network of veins and arteries within your  body, carrying oxygen to your cells. However, beyond these basic  facts, what do you know about your blood?  Blood transports absorbed nutrients to cells and waste products  from cells. It supports cellular metabolism by transporting  synthesized macromolecules from one cell type to another and  carrying waste products away from cells. Additionally, it transports  molecules, such as hormones, allowing for communication between  organs. The volume of blood coursing throughout an adult human  body is about 5 liters (1.3 US gallons) and accounts for approximately  8 percent of human body weight.  What Makes Up Blood and How Do These  Substances Support Blood Function?  Blood is about 78 percent water and 22 percent solids by volume.  The liquid part of blood is called plasma and it is mostly water (95  percent), but also contains proteins, ions, glucose, lipids, vitamins,  minerals, waste products, gases, enzymes, and hormones. We have  learned that the protein albumin is found in high concentrations  in the blood. Albumin helps maintain fluid balance between blood  and tissues, as well as helping to maintain a constant blood pH. We  have also learned that the water component of blood is essential for  its actions as a transport vehicle, and that the electrolytes carried  in blood help to maintain fluid balance and a constant pH.  Furthermore, the high water content of blood helps maintain body  temperature, and the constant flow of blood distributes heat  throughout the body. Blood is exceptionally good at temperature  The Cardiovascular System  |  85\n",
            "control, so much so that the many small blood vessels in your nose  are capable of warming frigid air to body temperature before it  reaches the lungs.  The cellular components of blood include red blood cells, white  blood cells, and platelets. Red blood cells are the most numerous  of the components. Each drop of blood contains millions of them.  Red blood cells are red because they each contain approximately  270 million hemoglobin proteins, which contain the mineral iron,  which turns red when bound to oxygen. The most vital duty of red  blood cells is to transport oxygen from the lungs to all cells in the  body so that cells can utilize oxygen to produce energy via aerobic  metabolism. The white blood cells that circulate in blood are part  of the immune system, and they survey the entire body looking for  foreign invaders to destroy. They make up about 1 percent of blood  volume. Platelets are fragments of cells that are always circulating in  the blood in case of an emergency. When blood vessels are injured,  platelets rush to the site of injury to plug the wound. Blood is  under a constant state of renewal and is synthesized from stem cells  residing in bone marrow. Red blood cells live for about 120 days,  white blood cells live anywhere from eighteen hours to one year, or  even longer, and platelets have a lifespan of about ten days.

            "The  cardiovascul ar system  transports  nutrients to  all cells and  carries  wastes out.  Nutrients In  Once absorbed from the small intestine, all nutrients require  transport to cells in need of their support. Additionally, molecules  manufactured in other cells sometimes require delivery to other  organ systems. Blood is the conduit and blood vessels are the  highway that support nutrient and molecule transport to all cells.  Water-soluble molecules, such as some vitamins, minerals, sugars,  and many proteins, move independently in blood. Fat-soluble  vitamins, triglycerides, cholesterol, and other lipids are packaged  into lipoproteins that allow for transport in the watery milieu of  blood. Many proteins, drugs, and hormones are dependent on  transport carriers, primarily by the plasma protein albumin. In  addition to transporting all of these molecules, blood transfers  oxygen taken in by the lungs to all cells in the body. As discussed,  The Cardiovascular System  |  87\n",
            "the iron-containing hemoglobin molecule in red blood cells serves  as the oxygen carrier.  Wastes Out  In the metabolism of macronutrients to energy, cells produce the  waste products carbon dioxide and water. As blood travels through  smaller and smaller vessels, the rate of blood flow is dramatically  reduced, allowing for efficient exchange of nutrients and oxygen for  cellular waste products through tiny capillaries. The kidneys remove  any excess water from the blood, and blood delivers the carbon  dioxide to the lungs where it is exhaled. Also, the liver produces  the waste product urea from the breakdown of amino acids and  detoxifies many harmful substances, all of which require transport  in the blood to the kidneys for excretion.  All for One, One for All  The eleven organ systems in the body completely depend on each  other for continued survival as a complex organism. Blood allows for  transport of nutrients, wastes, water, and heat, and is also a conduit  of communication between organ systems. Blood’s importance to  the rest of the body is aptly presented in its role in glucose delivery,  especially to the brain. The brain metabolizes, on average, 6 grams  of glucose per hour. In order to avert confusion, coma, and death,  glucose must be readily available to the brain at all times. To  accomplish this task, cells in the pancreas sense glucose levels in  the blood. If glucose levels are low, the hormone glucagon is  released into the blood and is transported to the liver where it  communicates the signal to ramp-up glycogen breakdown and  glucose synthesis. The liver does just that, and glucose is released  88  |  The Cardiovascular System\n",
            "into the blood, which transports it to the brain. Concurrently, blood  transports oxygen to support the metabolism of glucose to provide  energy in the brain. Healthy blood conducts its duties rapidly,  avoiding hypoglycemic coma and death. This is just one example of  the body’s survival mechanisms exemplifying life’s mantra “All for  one, one for all.”  What Makes Blood Healthy?  Maintaining healthy blood, including its continuous renewal, is  essential to support its vast array of vital functions. Blood is healthy  when it contains the appropriate amount of water and cellular  components and proper concentrations of dissolved substances,  such as albumin and electrolytes. As with all other tissues, blood  needs macro- and micronutrients to optimally function. In the bone  marrow, where blood cells are made, amino acids are required to  build the massive amount of hemoglobin packed within every red  blood cell, along with all other enzymes and cellular organelles  contained in each blood cell. Red blood cells, similar to the brain,  use only glucose as fuel, and it must be in constant supply to  support red-blood-cell metabolism. As with all other cells, the cells  in the blood are surrounded by a plasma membrane, which is  composed of mainly lipids. Blood health is also acutely sensitive to  deficiencies in some vitamins and minerals more than others.  What Can Blood Tests Tell You About Your  Health?

Neurons form the core of the central nervous system, which  consists of the brain, spinal cord, and other nerve bundles in the  body. The main function of the central nervous system is to sense  changes in the external environment and create a reaction to them.  For instance, if your finger comes into contact with a thorn on a  rose bush, a sensory neuron transmits a signal from your finger up  through the spinal cord and into the brain. Another neuron in the  brain sends a signal that travels back to the muscles in your hand  and stimulates muscles to contract and you jerk your finger away.  All of this happens within a tenth of a second. All nerve impulses  travel by the movement of charged sodium, potassium, calcium, and  chloride atoms. Nerves communicate with each other via chemicals  built from amino acids called neurotransmitters. Eating adequate  protein from a variety of sources will ensure the body gets all of the  different amino acids that are important for central nervous system  function.

Just as too much glucose is bad for other organs,  such as the kidneys and pancreas, it also produces negative effects  upon the brain. Excessive glucose levels in the blood can cause a  loss of cognitive function, and chronically high blood-glucose levels  can damage brain cells. The brain’s cognitive functions include  language processing, learning, perceiving, and thinking. Recent  scientific studies demonstrate that having continuously high blood- glucose levels substantially elevates the risk for developing  Alzheimer’s disease, which is the greatest cause of age-related  cognitive decline.  The good news is that much research is directed toward  determining the best diets and foods that slow cognitive decline and  maximize brain health. A study in the June 2010 issue of the Archives  of Neurology reports that people over age 65 who adhered to diets  that consisted of higher intakes of nuts, fish, poultry, tomatoes,  cruciferous vegetables, fruits, salad dressing, and dark green, and  leafy vegetables, as well as a lower intake of high-fat dairy products,  red meat, organ meat, and butter, had a much reduced risk for  Alzheimer’s disease.1  Other scientific studies provide supporting evidence that foods  rich in omega-3 fatty acids and/or antioxidants provide the brain  with protection against Alzheimer’s disease.

This is because  cells need to maintain oxidative metabolism for energy production  that continuously regenerates adenosine triphosphate (ATP). For  oxidative phosphorylation to occur, oxygen is used as a reactant and  carbon dioxide is released as a waste product. You may be surprised  to learn that although oxygen is a critical need for cells, it is actually  the accumulation of carbon dioxide that primarily drives your need  to breathe. Carbon dioxide is exhaled and oxygen is inhaled through  the respiratory system, which includes muscles to move air into  and out of the lungs, passageways through which air moves, and  microscopic gas exchange surfaces covered by capillaries. The  cardiovascular system transports gases from the lungs to tissues  throughout the body and vice versa. A variety of diseases can affect  the respiratory system, such as asthma, emphysema, chronic  obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and lung cancer. All of  these conditions affect the gas exchange process and result in  labored breathing and other difficulties.  The major organs of the respiratory system function primarily  to provide oxygen to body tissues for cellular respiration, remove  the waste product carbon dioxide, and help to maintain acid-base  balance. Portions of the respiratory system are also used for non- vital functions, such as sensing odors, producing speech, and for  straining, such as during childbirth or coughing.

The prevailing theory is that the overconsumption of  high-fat and high-sugar foods causes changes in muscle, fat, and  liver cells that leads to a diminished response from the pancreatic  hormone insulin. These cells are called “insulin-resistant.” Insulin is  released after a meal and instructs the liver and other tissues to take  up glucose and fatty acids that are circulating in the blood. When  cells are resistant to insulin they do not take up enough glucose and  fatty acids, so glucose and fatty acids remain at high concentrations  in the blood. The chronic elevation of glucose and fatty acids in the  blood also causes damage to other tissues over time, so that people  who have Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for cardiovascular  disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, and eye disease.

            "The Urinary System  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  The urinary system has roles you may be well aware of: cleansing  the blood and ridding the body of wastes probably come to mind.  However, there are additional, equally important functions played  by the system. Take for example, regulation of pH, a function shared  with the lungs and the buffers in the blood. Additionally, the  regulation of blood pressure is a role shared with the heart and  blood vessels. What about regulating the concentration of solutes  in the blood? Did you know that the kidney is important in  determining the concentration of red blood cells? Eighty-five  percent of the erythropoietin (EPO) produced to stimulate red blood  cell production is produced in the kidneys. The kidneys also  perform the final synthesis step of vitamin D production, converting  calcidiol to calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D.  If the kidneys fail, these functions are compromised or lost  altogether, with devastating effects on homeostasis. The affected  individual might experience weakness, lethargy, shortness of  breath, anemia, widespread edema (swelling), metabolic acidosis,  rising potassium levels, heart arrhythmias, and more. Each of these  functions is vital to your well-being and survival. The urinary  system, controlled by the nervous system, also stores urine until  a convenient time for disposal and then provides the anatomical  structures to transport this waste liquid to the outside of the body.  Failure of nervous control or the anatomical structures leading to  a loss of control of urination results in a condition called  incontinence.  Characteristics of the urine change, depending on influences  such as water intake, exercise, environmental temperature, nutrient  intake, and other factors . Some of the characteristics such as color  and odor are rough descriptors of your state of hydration. For  110  |  The Urinary System\n",
            "example, if you exercise or work outside, and sweat a great deal,  your urine will turn darker and produce a slight odor, even if you  drink plenty of water. Athletes are often advised to consume water  until their urine is clear. This is good advice; however, it takes  time for the kidneys to process body fluids and store it in the  bladder. Another way of looking at this is that the quality of the  urine produced is an average over the time it takes to make that  urine. Producing clear urine may take only a few minutes if you are  drinking a lot of water or several hours if you are working outside  and not drinking much.

The kidneys must produce a minimum urine volume  of about 500 mL/day to rid the body of wastes. Output below  this level may be caused by severe dehydration or renal disease  and is termed oliguria. The virtual absence of urine production is  112  |  The Urinary System\n",
            "termed anuria. Excessive urine production is polyuria, which may  occur in diabetes mellitus when blood glucose levels exceed the  filtration capacity of the kidneys and glucose appears in the urine.  The osmotic nature of glucose attracts water, leading to increased  water loss in the urine.  Urine is a fluid of variable composition that requires specialized  structures to remove it from the body safely and efficiently. Blood  is filtered, and the filtrate is transformed into urine at a relatively  constant rate throughout the day. This processed liquid is stored  until a convenient time for excretion. All structures involved in the  transport and storage of the urine are large enough to be visible to  the naked eye. This transport and storage system not only stores  the waste, but it protects the tissues from damage due to the wide  range of pH and osmolarity of the urine, prevents infection by  foreign organisms, and for the male, provides reproductive  functions.

It consists of over six hundred skeletal muscles,  as well as the heart muscle, the smooth muscles that surround  your entire alimentary canal, and all your arterial blood vessels (see  Figure 2.24 “The Muscular System in the Human Body”). Muscle  contraction relies on energy delivery to the muscle. Each movement  uses up cellular energy, and without an adequate energy supply,  muscle function suffers. Muscle, like the liver, can store the energy  from glucose in the large polymeric molecule glycogen. But unlike  the liver, muscles use up all of their own stored energy and do not  export it to other organs in the body. Muscle is not as susceptible  to low levels of blood glucose as the brain because it will readily use  alternate fuels such as fatty acids and protein to produce cellular  energy.

            "The Skeletal System  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Bone Structure and Function  Your bones are stronger than reinforced concrete. Bone tissue is  a composite of fibrous strands of collagen (a type of protein) that  resemble the steel rebar in concrete and a hardened mineralized  matrix that contains large amounts of calcium, just like concrete.  But this is where the similarities end. Bone outperforms reinforced  concrete by several orders of magnitude in compression and  tension strength tests. Why? The microarchitecture of bone is  complex and built to withstand extreme forces. Moreover, bone is  a living tissue that is continuously breaking down and forming new  bone to adapt to mechanical stresses.  Why Is the Skeletal System Important?  The human skeleton consists of 206 bones and other connective  tissues called ligaments, tendons, and cartilage. Ligaments connect  bones to other bones, tendons connect bones to muscles, and  cartilage provides bones with more flexibility and acts as a cushion  in the joints between bones. The skeleton’s many bones and  connective tissues allow for multiple types of movement such as  typing and running. The skeleton provides structural support and  protection for all the other organ systems in the body. The skull,  or cranium, is like a helmet and protects the eyes, ears, and brain.  The ribs form a cage that surrounds and protects the lungs and  heart. In addition to aiding in movement, protecting organs, and  120  |  The Skeletal System\n",
            "“Axial  Skeleton” by  Openstax  College / CC  BY 3.0  providing structural support, red and white blood cells and platelets  are synthesized in bone marrow. Another vital function of bones  is that they act as a storage depot for minerals such as calcium,  phosphorous, and magnesium. Although bone tissue may look  inactive at first glance, at the microscopic level you will find that  bones are continuously breaking down and reforming. Bones also  contain a complex network of canals, blood vessels, and nerves that  allow for nutrient transport and communication with other organ  systems.  Figure 2.25 Human Skeletal Structure  The human skeleton contains 206 bones. It is divided into two main  parts, the axial and appendicular.  The Skeletal System  |  121\n",
            "Bone Anatomy and Structure  To optimize bone health through nutrition, it is important to  understand bone anatomy. The skeleton is composed of two main  parts, the axial and the appendicular parts. The axial skeleton  consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage, and is  composed of eighty bones. The appendicular skeleton consists of  the shoulder girdle, pelvic girdle, and upper and lower extremities,  and is composed of 126 bones. Bones are also categorized by size  and shape. There are four types of bone: long bones, short bones,  flat bones, and irregular bones. The longest bone in your body is the  femur (thigh bone), which extends from your hip to your knee. It is a  long bone and functions to support your weight as you stand, walk,  or run. Your wrist is composed of eight irregular-shaped bones,  which allow for the intricate movements of your hands. Your twelve  ribs on each side of your body are curved flat bones that protect  your heart and lungs. Thus, the bones’ different sizes and shapes  allow for their different functions.  Bones are composed of approximately 65 percent inorganic  material known as mineralized matrix. This mineralized matrix  consists of mostly crystallized hydroxyapatite. The bone’s hard  crystal matrix of bone tissue gives it its rigid structure. The other  35 percent of bone is organic material, most of which is the fibrous  protein collagen. The collagen fibers are networked throughout  bone tissue and provide it with flexibility and strength. The bones’  inorganic and organic materials are structured into two different  tissue types. There is spongy bone, also called trabecular or  cancellous bone, and compact bone, also called cortical bone  (Figure 2.26 “The Arrangement of Bone Tissues”). The two tissue  types differ in their microarchitecture and porosity. Trabecular  bone is 50 to 90 percent porous and appears as a lattice-like  structure under the microscope. It is found at the ends of long  bones, in the cores of vertebrae, and in the pelvis. Trabecular bone  tissue makes up about 20 percent of the adult skeleton. The more  122  |  The Skeletal System\n",
            "Image  by Gtirouflet  / CC BY-SA  3.0  dense cortical bone is about 10 percent porous and it looks like  many concentric circles, similar to the rings in a tree trunk,  sandwiched together (Figure 2.27 “Cortical (Compact) Bone”).  Cortical bone tissue makes up approximately 80 percent of the adult  skeleton. It surrounds all trabecular tissue and is the only bone  tissue in the shafts of long bones.  Figure 2.26 The Arrangement of Bone Tissues  The two basic tissue types of bones are trabecular and cortical. This  photo shows normal (left) and degraded (right) trabecular (spongy)  bone.

            "“Compact  Bone with  osteons”  by  Lord of  Konrad /  CC0  Bone tissue is arranged in an organized manner. A thin membrane,  called the periosteum, surrounds the bone. It contains connective  tissue with many blood vessels and nerves. Lying below the  periosteum is the cortical bone. In some bones, the cortical bone  surrounds the less-dense trabecular bone and the bone marrow lies  within the trabecular bone, but not all bones contain trabecular  tissue or marrow.  Bone Tissues and Cells, Modeling and  Remodeling  Bone tissue contains many different cell types that constantly resize  and reshape bones throughout growth and adulthood. Bone tissue  cells include osteoprogenitor cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and  osteocytes. The osteoprogenitor cells are cells that have not  matured yet. Once they are stimulated, some will become  osteoblasts, the bone builders, and others will become osteoclasts,  the cells that break bone down. Osteocytes are the most abundant  124  |  The Skeletal System\n",
            "cells in bone tissue. Osteocytes are star-shaped cells that are  networked throughout the bone via their long cytoplasmic arms  that allow for the exchange of nutrients and other factors from  bones to the blood and lymph.  Bone Modeling and Remodeling  During infancy, childhood, and adolescence, bones are continuously  growing and changing shape through two processes called growth  (ossification) and modeling. In fact, in the first year of life, almost  100 percent of the bone tissue in the skeleton is replaced. In the  process of modeling, bone tissue is dismantled at one site and built  up at a different site. In adulthood, our bones stop growing and  modeling, but continue to go through a process of bone remodeling.  In the process of remodeling, bone tissue is degraded and built up  at the same location. About 10 percent of bone tissue is remodeled  each year in adults. Bones adapt their structure to the forces acting  upon them, even in adulthood. This phenomenon is called Wolff’s  law, which states that bones will develop a structure that is best  able to resist the forces acting upon them. This is why exercising,  especially when it involves weight-bearing activities, increases bone  strength.  The first step in bone remodeling is osteocyte activation.  Osteocytes  detect  changes  in  mechanical  forces,  calcium  homeostasis, or hormone levels. In the second step, osteoclasts are  recruited to the site of the degradation. Osteoclasts are large cells  with a highly irregular ruffled membrane. These cells fuse tightly  to the bone and secrete hydrogen ions, which acidify the local  environment and dissolve the minerals in the bone tissue matrix.  This process is called bone resorption and resembles pit excavation.  Our bodies excavate pits in our bone tissue because bones act as  storehouses for calcium and other minerals. Bones supply these  minerals to other body tissues as the demand arises. Bone tissue  The Skeletal System  |  125\n",
            "also remodels when it breaks so that it can repair itself. Moreover,  if you decide to train to run a marathon your bones will restructure  themselves by remodeling to be better able to sustain the forces of  their new function.  After a certain amount of bone is excavated, the osteoclasts begin  to die and bone resorption stops. In the third step of bone  remodeling, the site is prepared for building. In this stage, sugars  and proteins accumulate along the bone’s surface, forming a cement  line which acts to form a strong bond between the old bone and  the new bone that will be made. These first three steps take  approximately two to three weeks to complete. In the last step of  bone remodeling, osteoblasts lay down new osteoid tissue that fills  up the cavities that were excavated during the resorption process.  Osteoid is bone matrix tissue that is composed of proteins such as  collagen and is not mineralized yet. To make collagen, vitamin C is  required. A symptom of vitamin C deficiency (known as scurvy) is  bone pain, which is caused by diminished bone remodeling. After  the osteoid tissue is built up, the bone tissue begins to mineralize.  The last step of bone remodeling continues for months, and for a  much longer time afterward the mineralized bone is continuously  packed in a more dense fashion.  Thus, we can say that bone is a living tissue that continually  adapts itself to mechanical stress through the process of  remodeling. For bone tissue to remodel certain nutrients such as  calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, fluoride, vitamin D, and vitamin K  are required.  Bone Mineral Density Is an Indicator of Bone  Health  Bone mineral density (BMD) is a measurement of the amount of  calcified tissue in grams per centimeter squared of bone tissue.  BMD can be thought of as the total amount of bone mass in a  126  |  The Skeletal System\n",
            "defined area. When BMD is high, bone strength will be great. Similar  to measuring blood pressure to predict the risk of stroke, a BMD  measurement can help predict the risk of bone fracture. The most  common tool used to measure BMD is called dual energy X-ray  absorptiometry (DEXA). During this procedure, a person lies on  their back and a DEXA scanner passes two X-ray beams through  their body. The amount of X-ray energy that passes through the  bone is measured for both beams. The total amount of the X-ray  energy that passes through a person varies depending on their bone  thickness. Using this information and a defined area of bone, the  amount of calcified tissue in grams per unit area (cm2) is calculated.  Most often the DEXA scan focuses on measuring BMD in the hip  and the spine. These measurements are then used as indicators of  overall bone strength and health. DEXA is the cheapest and most  accurate way to measure BMD. It also uses the lowest dose of  radiation. Other methods of measuring BMD include quantitative  computed tomography (QCT) and radiographic absorptiometry.  People at risk for developing bone disease are advised to have a  DEXA scan. We will discuss the many risk factors linked to an  increased incidence of osteoporosis and the steps a person can take  to prevent the disease from developing.

            "The Immune System  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  The immune system comprises several types of white blood cells  that circulate in the blood and lymph. Their jobs are to seek, recruit,  attack, and destroy foreign invaders, such as bacteria and viruses.  Other less realized components of the immune system are the skin  (which acts as a barricade), mucus (which traps and entangles  microorganisms), and even the bacteria in the large intestine (which  prevent the colonization of bad bacteria in the gut). Immune system  functions are completely dependent on dietary nutrients. In fact,  malnutrition is the leading cause of immune-system deficiency  worldwide. When immune system functions are inadequate there is  a marked increase in the chance of getting an infection. Children  in many poor, developing countries have protein- and/or energy- deficient diets that are causative of two different syndromes,  kwashiorkor and marasmus. These children often die from  infections that their bodies would normally have fought off, but  because their protein and/or energy intake is so low, the immune  system cannot perform its functions.  Other nutrients, such as iron, zinc, selenium, copper, folate, and  vitamins A, B6, C, D, and E, all provide benefits to immune system  function. Deficiencies in these nutrients can cause an increased risk  for infection and death. Zinc deficiency results in suppression of the  immune system’s barrier functions by damaging skin cells; it is also  associated with a decrease in the number of circulating white blood  cells.

Equally important to remember is that  multiple studies show that it is best to obtain your minerals and  vitamins from eating a variety of healthy foods.  Just as undernutrition compromises immune system health, so  does overnutrition. People who are obese are at increased risk for  developing immune system disorders such as asthma, rheumatoid  arthritis, and some cancers. Both the quality and quantity of fat  affect immune system function. High intakes of saturated and trans  fats negatively affect the immune system, whereas increasing your  intake of omega-3 fatty acids, found in salmon and other oily fish,  decreases inflammatory responses. High intakes of omega-3 fatty  acids are linked to a reduction in the risk of developing certain  autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and are used  as part of a comprehensive treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.  1. Aggarwal R, Sentz J, Miller MA.

The major physical factors  contributing to body weight are water weight, muscle tissue mass,  bone tissue mass, and fat tissue mass. Overweight refers to having  more weight than normal for a particular height and may be the  result of water weight, muscle weight, or fat mass. Obese refers  specifically to having excess body fat. In most cases people who are  overweight also have excessive body fat and therefore body weight  is an indicator of obesity in much of the population.  The “ideal” healthy body weight for a particular person is  dependent on many things, such as frame size, sex, muscle mass,  bone density, age, and height. The perception of the “ideal” body  weight is additionally dependent on cultural factors and the  mainstream societal advertisement of beauty.  To standardize the “ideal” body weight and relate it to health,  scientists have devised mathematical formulas to better define a  healthy weight. These mathematically derived measurements are  used by health professionals to correlate disease risk with  populations of people and at the individual level. A clinician will take  two measurements, one of weight and one of fat mass, in order to  diagnose obesity.

BMI Limitations  A BMI is a fairly simple measurement and does not take into account  fat mass or fat distribution in the body, both of which are additional  predictors of disease risk. Body fat weighs less than muscle mass.  Therefore, BMI can sometimes underestimate the amount of body  fat in overweight or obese people and overestimate it in more  muscular people. For instance, a muscular athlete will have more  muscle mass (which is heavier than fat mass) than a sedentary  individual of the same height. Based on their BMIs the muscular  athlete would be less “ideal” and may be categorized as more  overweight or obese than the sedentary individual; however this is  an infrequent problem with BMI calculation. Additionally, an older  person with osteoporosis (decreased bone mass) will have a lower  BMI than an older person of the same height without osteoporosis,  even though the person with osteoporosis may have more fat mass.  BMI is a useful inexpensive tool to categorize people and is highly  correlative with disease risk, but other measurements are needed to  diagnose obesity and more accurately assess disease risk.  Body Fat and Its Distribution  Next we’ll discuss how to measure body fat, and why distribution of  body fat is also important to consider when determining health.  136  |  Indicators of Health: Body Mass Index, Body Fat Content, and Fat Distribution\n",

Having more fat mass may be indicative of disease  risk, but fat mass also varies with sex, age, and physical activity  level. Females have more fat mass, which is needed for reproduction  and, in part, is a consequence of different levels of hormones. The  optimal fat content of a female is between 20 and 30 percent of  her total weight and for a male is between 12 and 20 percent. Fat  mass can be measured in a variety of ways. The simplest and lowest- cost way is the skin-fold test. A health professional uses a caliper to  measure the thickness of skin on the back, arm, and other parts of  the body and compares it to standards to assess body fatness. It is  a noninvasive and fairly accurate method of measuring fat mass, but  similar to BMI, is compared to standards of mostly young to middle- aged adults.  Figure 2.29 Measuring Skinfold Thickness Using Calipers  Other methods of measuring fat mass are more expensive and more  technically challenging. They include:  • Underwater weighing.

First, a person  is weighed outside the chamber and then weighed again while  immersed in water. Bone and muscle weigh more than water,  but fat does not—therefore a person with a higher muscle and  bone mass will weigh more when in water than a person with  less bone and muscle mass.  • Bioelectric Impedance Analysis (BIA). This device is based on  the fact that fat slows down the passage of electricity through  the body. When a small amount of electricity is passed through  the body, the rate at which it travels is used to determine body  composition. These devices are also sold for home use and  commonly called body composition scales.  Figure 2.30 BIA Hand Device  • Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).

Fat can be found  in different areas in the body and it does not all act the same,  meaning it differs physiologically based on location. Fat deposited in  the abdominal cavity is called visceral fat and it is a better predictor  of disease risk than total fat mass. Visceral fat releases hormones  and inflammatory factors that contribute to disease risk. The only  tool required for measuring visceral fat is a measuring tape.

A human body is made up of mostly water.  An adult consists of about 37 to 42 liters of water, or about eighty  pounds. Fortunately, humans have compartmentalized tissues;  otherwise we might just look like a water balloon! Newborns are  approximately 70 percent water. Adult males typically are composed  of about 60 percent water and females are about 55 percent water.  (This gender difference reflects the differences in body-fat content,  since body fat is practically water-free. This also means that if a  person gains weight in the form of fat the percentage of total body  water content declines.) As we age, total body water content also  diminishes so that by the time we are in our eighties the percent  of water in our bodies has decreased to around 45 percent. Does  the loss in body water play a role in the aging process? Alas, no  one knows. But, we do know that dehydration accelerates the aging  process whereas keeping hydrated decreases headaches, muscle  aches, and kidney stones. Additionally a study conducted at the Fred  Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle found that women  who drank more than five glasses of water each day had a  significantly decreased risk for developing colon cancer.1  1. Shannon JE, et al.

For example,  in water sodium chloride (the chemical name for table salt)  dissociates into sodium cations (Na+) and chloride anions (Cl−).  Solutes refers to all dissolved substances in a fluid, which may  be charged, such as sodium (Na+), or uncharged, such as glucose.  In the human body, water and solutes are distributed into two  compartments: inside cells, called intracellular, and outside cells,  called extracellular. The extracellular water compartment is  subdivided into the spaces between cells also known as interstitial,  blood plasma, and other bodily fluids such as the cerebrospinal fluid  which surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord (Figure 3.2  “Distribution of Body Water”). The composition of solutes differs  between the fluid compartments. For instance, more protein is  inside cells than outside and more chloride anions exist outside of  cells than inside.

            "between cells and their surrounding environment. Osmoregulation  is the control of fluid balance and composition in the body. The  processes involved keep fluids from becoming too dilute or too  concentrated. Fluid compartments are separated by selectively  permeable membranes, which allow some things, such as water,  to move through while other substances require special transport  proteins, channels, and often energy. The movement of water  between fluid compartments happens by osmosis, which is simply  the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane  from an area where it is highly concentrated to an area where it  is not so concentrated. Water is never transported actively; that is,  it never takes energy for water to move between compartments.  Although cells do not directly control water movement, they do  control movement of electrolytes and other solutes and thus  indirectly regulate water movement by controlling where there will  be regions of high and low concentrations.  Cells maintain their water volume at a constant level, but the  composition of solutes in a cell is in a continuous state of flux.  This is because cells are bringing nutrients in, metabolizing them,  and disposing of waste products. To maintain water balance a cell  controls the movement of electrolytes to keep the total number of  dissolved particles, called osmolality the same inside and outside  (Figure 3.3 “Osmoregulation”). The total number of dissolved  substances is the same inside and outside a cell, but the  composition of the fluids differs between compartments. For  example, sodium exists in extracellular fluid at fourteen times the  concentration as compared to that inside a cell.

            "“Osmosis” by  Mariana  Ruiz  /  Public  Domain  Cells maintain water volume by actively controlling electrolyte  concentrations. Human erythrocytes (red blood cells) are shown  here. Three conditions are shown: hypertonic conditions (where  the erythrocytes contract and appear “spiky”), isotonic conditions  (where the erythrocytes appear normal) and hypotonic conditions  (where the etrythrocytes expand and become more round).  If a cell is placed in a solution that contains fewer dissolved  particles (hypotonic solution) than the cell itself, water moves into  the more concentrated cell, causing it to swell. Alternatively, if a  cell is placed in a solution that is more concentrated (known as a  hypertonic solution) water moves from inside the cell to the outside,  causing it to shrink. Cells keep their water volume constant by  pumping electrolytes in and out in an effort to balance the  concentrations of dissolved particles on either side of their  membranes. When a solution contains an equal concentration of  dissolved particles on either side of the membrane, it is known as an  isotonic solution.    154  |  Overview of Fluid and Electrolyte Balance\n",

Of all the nutrients,  water is the most critical as its absence proves lethal within a few  days. Organisms have adapted numerous mechanisms for water  conservation. Water uses in the human body can be loosely  categorized into four basic functions: transportation vehicle,  medium for chemical reactions, lubricant/shock absorber, and  temperature regulator.  156  |  Water’s Importance to Vitality\n",
            "Water is the foundation of all life—the surface of the earth is 70  percent water; the volume of water in humans is about 60 percent.  Water As a Transportation Vehicle  Water is called the “universal solvent” because more substances  dissolve in it than any other fluid. Molecules dissolve in water  because of the hydrogen and oxygen molecules ability to loosely  bond with other molecules. Molecules of water (H2O) surround  substances, suspending them in a sea of water molecules. The  solvent action of water allows for substances to be more readily  transported. A pile of undissolved salt would be difficult to move  throughout tissues, as would a bubble of gas or a glob of fat. Blood,  the primary transport fluid in the body is about 78 percent water.  Dissolved substances in blood include proteins, lipoproteins,  glucose, electrolytes, and metabolic waste products, such as carbon  dioxide and urea. These substances are either dissolved in the  watery surrounding of blood to be transported to cells to support  basic functions or are removed from cells to prevent waste build- up and toxicity. Blood is not just the primary vehicle of transport in  the body, but also as a fluid tissue blood structurally supports blood  vessels that would collapse in its absence. For example, the brain  which consists of 75 percent water is used to provide structure.  Water As a Medium for Chemical Reactions  Water is required for even the most basic chemical reactions.  Proteins fold into their functional shape based on how their amino- acid sequences react with water. These newly formed enzymes  must conduct their specific chemical reactions in a medium, which  in all organisms is water.

Additionally, water is involved in many enzymatic reactions as an  agent to break bonds or, by its removal from a molecule, to form  bonds.  Water As a Lubricant/Shock Absorber  Many may view the slimy products of a sneeze as gross, but  sneezing is essential for removing irritants and could not take place  without water. Mucus, which is not only essential to discharge nasal  irritants, is also required for breathing, transportation of nutrients  along the gastrointestinal tract, and elimination of waste materials  through the rectum. Mucus is composed of more than 90 percent  water and a front-line defense against injury and foreign invaders.  It protects tissues from irritants, entraps pathogens, and contains  immune-system cells that destroy pathogens. Water is also the main  component of the lubricating fluid between joints and eases the  movement of articulated bones.  The aqueous and vitreous humors, which are fluids that fill the  extra space in the eyes and the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding  the brain and spinal cord, are primarily water and buffer these  organs against sudden changes in the environment. Watery fluids  surrounding organs provide both chemical and mechanical  protection. Just two weeks after fertilization water fills the amniotic  sac in a pregnant woman providing a cushion of protection for the  developing embryo.

            "thermoregulation is to balance heat gain with heat loss and body  water plays an important role in accomplishing this. Human life  is supported within a narrow range of temperature, with the  temperature set point of the body being 98.6°F (37°C). Too low or  too high of a temperature causes enzymes to stop functioning and  metabolism is halted. At 82.4°F (28°C) muscle failure occurs and  hypothermia sets in. At the opposite extreme of 111.2°F (44°C) the  central nervous system fails and death results. Water is good at  storing heat, an attribute referred to as heat capacity and thus helps  maintain the temperature set point of the body despite changes in  the surrounding environment.  There are several mechanisms in place that move body water  from place to place as a method to distribute heat in the body and  equalize body temperature (Figure 3.4 “Thermoregulatory Center”).  The hypothalamus in the brain is the thermoregulatory center. The  hypothalamus contains special protein sensors that detect blood  temperature. The skin also contains temperature sensors that  respond quickly to changes in immediate surroundings. In response  to cold sensors in the skin, a neural signal is sent to the  hypothalamus, which then sends a signal to smooth muscle tissue  surrounding blood vessels causing them to constrict and reduce  blood flow. This reduces heat lost to the environment. The  hypothalamus also sends signals to muscles to erect hairs and shiver  and to endocrine glands like the thyroid to secrete hormones  capable of ramping up metabolism. These actions increase heat  conservation and stimulate its production in the body in response  to cooling temperatures.

            "Thirst Mechanism: Why Do We Drink?  Thirst is an osmoregulatory mechanism to increase water input.  The thirst mechanism is activated in response to changes in water  volume in the blood, but is even more sensitive to changes in blood  osmolality. Blood osmolality is primarily driven by the concentration  of sodium cations. The urge to drink results from a complex  interplay of hormones and neuronal responses that coordinate to  increase water input and contribute toward fluid balance and  composition in the body. The “thirst center” is contained within  the hypothalamus, a portion of the brain that lies just above the  brainstem. In older people the thirst mechanism is not as responsive  and as we age there is a higher risk for dehydration. Thirst happens  in the following sequence of physiological events:  1. Receptor proteins in the kidney, heart, and hypothalamus  detect decreased fluid volume or increased sodium  concentration in the blood.  2. Hormonal and neural messages are relayed to the brain’s thirst  center in the hypothalamus.  The hypothalamus sends neural signals to higher sensory areas  in the cortex of the brain, stimulating the conscious thought to  drink.  3. Fluids are consumed.  4. Receptors in the mouth and stomach detect mechanical  movements involved with fluid ingestion.  5. Neural signals are sent to the brain and the thirst mechanism  is shut off.  The physiological control of thirst is the backup mechanism to  increase water input. Fluid intake is controlled primarily by  conscious eating and drinking habits dependent on social and  cultural influences. For example, you might have a habit of drinking  a glass of orange juice and eating a bowl of cereal every morning  before school or work.  166  |  Regulation of Water Balance\n",

Another 500 milliliters is lost through  our skin. The second type of output is sensible water loss, meaning  we are aware of it. Urine accounts for about 1,500 milliliters of water  output, and feces account for roughly 100 milliliters of water output.

The kidneys filter about 190 liters of blood and produce (on average)  1.5 liters of urine per day. Urine is mostly water, but it also contains  electrolytes and waste products, such as urea. The amount of water  filtered from the blood and excreted as urine is dependent on the  amount of water in, and the electrolyte composition in the blood.  Kidneys have protein sensors that detect blood volume from the  pressure, or stretch, in the blood vessels of the kidneys. When blood  volume is low, kidney cells detect decreased pressure and secrete  the enzyme, renin. Renin travels in the blood and cleaves another  protein into the active hormone, angiotensin. Angiotensin targets  three different organs (the adrenal glands, the hypothalamus, and  168  |  Regulation of Water Balance\n",
            "the muscle tissue surrounding the arteries) to rapidly restore blood  volume and, consequently, pressure.  The Hypothalamus Detects Blood Osmolality  Sodium and fluid balance are intertwined. Osmoreceptors  (specialized protein receptors) in the hypothalamus detect sodium  concentration in the blood. In response to a high sodium level,  the hypothalamus activates the thirst mechanism and concurrently  stimulates the release of antidiuretic hormone. Thus, it is not only  kidneys that stimulate antidiuretic- hormone release, but also the  hypothalamus. This dual control of antidiuretic hormone release  allows for the body to respond to both decreased blood volume and  increased blood osmolality.  The Adrenal Glands Detect Blood Osmolality  Cells in the adrenal glands sense when sodium levels are low and  potassium levels are high in the blood. In response to either  stimulus, they release aldosterone. Aldosterone is released in  response to angiotensin stimulation and is controlled by blood  electrolyte  concentrations.  In  either  case,  aldosterone  communicates the same message, to increase sodium reabsorption  and consequently water reabsorption. In exchange, for the  reabsorption of sodium and water, potassium is excreted.  Regulation of Water Balance  |  169\n",

            "Electrolytes Important for  Fluid Balance  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Cells are about 75 percent water and blood plasma is about 95  percent water. Why then, does the water not flow from blood  plasma to cells? The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.  A concentration gradient is a form of potential energy, like water  172  |  Electrolytes Important for Fluid Balance\n",
            "above a dam. When water falls through a dam the potential energy  is changed to moving energy (kinetic), that in turn is captured by  turbines. Similarly, when an electrolyte at higher concentration in  the extracellular fluid is transported into a cell, the potential energy  is harnessed and used to perform work.  Cells are constantly transporting nutrients in and wastes out.  How is the concentration of solutes maintained if they are in a  state of flux? This is where electrolytes come into play. The cell  (or more specifically the numerous sodium-potassium pumps in  its membrane) continuously pumps sodium ions out to establish  a chemical gradient. The transport protein, called the glucose  symporter, uses the sodium gradient to power glucose movement  into the cell. Sodium and glucose both move into the cell. Water  passively follows the sodium. To restore balance, the sodium- potassium pump transfers sodium back to the extracellular fluid and  water follows. Every cycle of the sodium-potassium pump involves  the movement of three sodium ions out of a cell, in exchange for  two potassium ions into a cell. To maintain charge neutrality on the  outside of cells every sodium cation is followed by a chloride anion.  Every cycle of the pump costs one molecule of ATP (adenosine  triphosphate). The constant work of the sodium-potassium pump  maintains the solute  equilibrium  and consequently, water  distribution between intracellular and extracellular fluids.  The unequal movement of the positively charged sodium and  potassium ions makes intracellular fluid more negatively charged  than the extracellular fluid. This charge gradient is another source  of energy that a cell uses to perform work. You will soon learn  that this charge gradient and the sodium-potassium pump are also  essential for nerve conduction and muscle contraction. The many  functions of the sodium-potassium pump in the body account for  approximately a quarter of total resting energy expenditure.

            "Sodium  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Sodium is vital not only for maintaining fluid balance but also for  many other essential functions. In contrast to many minerals,  sodium absorption in the small intestine is extremely efficient and  in a healthy individual all excess sodium is excreted by the kidneys.  In fact, very little sodium is required in the diet (about 200  milligrams) because the kidneys actively reabsorb sodium. Kidney  reabsorption of sodium is hormonally controlled, allowing for a  relatively constant sodium concentration in the blood.  Other Functions of Sodium in the Body  The second notable function of sodium is in nerve impulse  transmission. Nerve impulse transmission results from the  transport of sodium cations into a nerve cell, which creates a charge  difference (or voltage) between the nerve cell and its extracellular  environment. Similar to how a current moves along a wire, a sodium  current moves along a nerve cell. Stimulating a muscle contraction  also involves the movement of sodium ions as well as other ion  movements.  Sodium is essential for nutrient absorption in the small intestine  and also for nutrient reabsorption in the kidney. Amino acids,  glucose and water must make their way from the small intestine to  the blood. To do so, they pass through intestinal cells on their way  to the blood. The transport of nutrients through intestinal cells is  facilitated by the sodium-potassium pump, which by moving sodium  out of the cell, creates a higher sodium concentration outside of the  cell (requiring ATP).  176  |  Sodium\n",
            "Sodium Imbalances  Sweating is a homeostatic mechanism for maintaining body  temperature, which influences fluid and electrolyte balance. Sweat  is mostly water but also contains some electrolytes, mostly sodium  and chloride. Under normal environmental conditions (i.e., not hot,  humid days) water and sodium loss through sweat is negligible,  but is highly variable among individuals. It is estimated that sixty  minutes of high-intensity physical activity, like playing a game of  tennis, can produce approximately one liter of sweat; however the  amount of sweat produced is highly dependent on environmental  conditions. A liter of sweat typically contains between 1 and 2 grams  of sodium and therefore exercising for multiple hours can result in a  high amount of sodium loss in some people. Additionally, hard labor  can produce substantial sodium loss through sweat. In either case,  the lost sodium is easily replaced in the next snack or meal.  In athletes hyponatremia, or a low blood-sodium level, is not  so much the result of excessive sodium loss in sweat, but rather  drinking too much water. The excess water dilutes the sodium  concentration in blood. Illnesses causing vomiting, sweating, and  diarrhea may also cause hyponatremia. The symptoms of  hyponatremia, also called water intoxication (since it is often the  root cause) include nausea, muscle cramps, confusion, dizziness,  and in severe cases, coma and death. The physiological events that  occur in water intoxication are the following:  1. Excessive sodium loss and/or water intake.  2. Sodium levels fall in blood and in the fluid between cells.  3. Water moves to where solutes are more concentrated (i.e. into  cells).  4. Cells swell.  5.

Sports drinks  are better at restoring fluid and blood-glucose levels than replacing  electrolytes. During an endurance event you would be better off  drinking water and eating an energy bar that contains sugars,  proteins, and electrolytes. The American College of Sports Medicine  suggests if you are exercising for longer than one hour you eat one  high carbohydrate (25–40 grams) per hour of exercise along with  ample water.1  Watch out for the fat content, as sometimes energy bars contain  a hefty dose. If you’re not exercising over an hour at high intensity,  you can skip the sports drinks, but not the water. For those who do  not exercise or do so at low to moderate intensity, sports drinks are  another source of extra calories, sugar, and salt.  Needs and Dietary Sources of Sodium  The IOM has set an AI level for sodium for healthy adults between  the ages of nineteen and fifty at 1,500 milligrams (Table 3.2 “Dietary  Reference Intakes for Sodium”). Table salt is approximately 40  percent sodium and 60 percent chloride. As a reference point, only  ⅔ teaspoon of salt is needed in the diet to meet the AI for sodium.  The AI takes into account the amount of sodium lost in sweat during  recommended physical activity levels and additionally provides for  the sufficient intake of other nutrients, such as chloride.

The IOM estimates that greater than 95  percent of men and 75 percent of women in America consume  salt in excess of the UL. Many scientific studies demonstrate that  reducing salt intake prevents hypertension, is helpful in reducing  blood pressure after hypertension is diagnosed, and reduces the  risk for cardiovascular disease. The IOM recommends that people  over fifty, African Americans, diabetics, and those with chronic  kidney disease should consume no more than 1,500 milligrams of  sodium per day. The American Heart Association (AHA) states that  all Americans, not just those listed, should consume less than 1,500  milligrams of sodium per day to prevent cardiovascular disease.

In addition to  passively following sodium, chloride has its own protein channels  that reside in cell membranes. These protein channels are especially  abundant in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and lungs.  Chloride’s Role in Fluid Balance  Chloride aids in fluid balance mainly because it follows sodium in  order to maintain charge neutrality. Chloride channels also play a  role in regulating fluid secretion, such as pancreatic juice into the  small intestine and the flow of water into mucus. Fluid secretion and  mucus are important for many of life’s processes. Their importance  is exemplified in the signs and symptoms of the genetic disease,  cystic fibrosis.  Cystic Fibrosis  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most prevalent inherited diseases  in people of European descent. It is caused by a mutation in a  protein that transports chloride ions out of the cell. CF’s signs and  symptoms include salty skin, poor digestion and absorption (leading  to poor growth), sticky mucus accumulation in the lungs (causing  increased susceptibility to respiratory infections), liver damage, and  infertility.  190  |  Chloride\n",
            "Other Functions of Chloride  Chloride has several other functions in the body, most importantly  in acid-base balance. Blood pH is maintained in a narrow range and  the number of positively charged substances is equal to the number  of negatively charged substances. Proteins, such as albumin, as well  as bicarbonate ions and chloride ions, are negatively charged and  aid in maintaining blood pH. Hydrochloric acid (a gastric acid  composed of chlorine and hydrogen) aids in digestion and also  prevents the growth of unwanted microbes in the stomach.  Immune-system cells require chloride, and red blood cells use  chloride anions to remove carbon dioxide from the body.  Chloride Imbalances  Low dietary intake of chloride and more often diarrhea can cause  low blood levels of chloride. Symptoms typically are similar to those  of hyponatremia and include weakness, nausea, and headache.  Excess chloride in the blood is rare with no characteristic signs or  symptoms.  Needs and Dietary Sources of Chloride  Most chloride in the diet comes from salt. (Salt is 60 percent  chloride.) A teaspoon of salt equals 5,600 milligrams, with each  teaspoon of salt containing 3,400 milligrams of chloride and 2,200  milligrams of sodium. The chloride AI for adults, set by the IOM, is  2,300 milligrams. Therefore just ⅔ teaspoon of table salt per day  is sufficient for chloride as well as sodium.

In the  small intestine, the elements of sodium chloride split into sodium  cations and chloride anions. Chloride follows the sodium ion into  intestinal cells passively, making chloride absorption quite efficient.  When chloride exists as a potassium salt, it is also well absorbed.  Other mineral salts, such as magnesium chloride, are not absorbed  as well, but bioavailability still remains high.

            "Potassium  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Potassium is the most abundant positively charged ion inside of  cells. Ninety percent of potassium exists in intracellular fluid, with  about 10 percent in extracellular fluid, and only 1 percent in blood  plasma. As with sodium, potassium levels in the blood are strictly  regulated. The hormone aldosterone is what primarily controls  potassium levels, but other hormones (such as insulin) also play  a role. When potassium levels in the blood increase, the adrenal  glands release aldosterone. The aldosterone acts on the collecting  ducts of kidneys, where it stimulates an increase in the number  of sodium-potassium pumps. Sodium is then reabsorbed and more  potassium is excreted. Because potassium is required for  maintaining sodium levels, and hence fluid balance, about 200  milligrams of potassium are lost from the body every day.  Other Functions of Potassium in the Body  Nerve impulse involves not only sodium, but also potassium. A nerve  impulse moves along a nerve via the movement of sodium ions into  the cell. To end the impulse, potassium ions rush out of the nerve  cell, thereby decreasing the positive charge inside the nerve cell.  This diminishes the stimulus. To restore the original concentrations  of ions between the intracellular and extracellular fluid, the sodium- potassium pump transfers sodium ions out in exchange for  potassium  ions  in.

            "Potassium also is involved in protein synthesis, energy metabolism,  and platelet function, and acts as a buffer in blood, playing a role in  acid-base balance.  Imbalances of Potassium  Insufficient potassium levels in the body (hypokalemia) can be  caused by a low dietary intake of potassium or by high sodium  intakes, but more commonly it results from medications that  increase water excretion, mainly diuretics. The signs and symptoms  of hypokalemia are related to the functions of potassium in nerve  cells and consequently skeletal and smooth-muscle contraction.  The signs and symptoms include muscle weakness and cramps,  respiratory distress, and constipation. Severe potassium depletion  can cause the heart to have abnormal contractions and can even  be fatal. High levels of potassium in the blood, or hyperkalemia,  also affects the heart. It is a silent condition as it often displays  no signs or symptoms. Extremely high levels of potassium in the  blood disrupt the electrical impulses that stimulate the heart and  can cause the heart to stop. Hyperkalemia is usually the result of  kidney dysfunction.  Needs and Dietary Sources of Potassium  The IOM based their AIs for potassium on the levels associated with  a decrease in blood pressure, a reduction in salt sensitivity, and a  minimal risk of kidney stones. For adult male and females above  the age of nineteen, the adequate intake for potassium is 4,700  grams per day.

            "Consequences of Deficiency  or Excess  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  As with all nutrients, having too much or too little water has health  consequences. Excessive water intake can dilute the levels of critical  electrolytes in the blood. Water intoxication is rare, however when  it does happen, it can be deadly. On the other hand, having too little  water in the body is common. In fact, diarrhea-induced dehydration  is the number-one cause of early-childhood death worldwide. In  this section we will discuss subtle changes in electrolytes that  compromise health on a chronic basis.  High-Hydration Status: Water Intoxication/ Hyponatremia  Water intoxication mainly affects athletes who overhydrate. Water  intoxication is extremely rare, primarily because healthy kidneys  are capable of excreting up to one liter of excess water per hour.  Overhydration was unfortunately demonstrated in 2007 by Jennifer  Strange, who drank six liters of water in three hours while  competing in a “Hold Your Wee for a Wii” radio contest. Afterward  she complained of a headache, vomited, and died.  Low-Hydration Status: Dehydration  Dehydration refers to water loss from the body without adequate  Consequences of Deficiency or Excess  |  199\n",
            "replacement. It can result from either water loss or electrolyte  imbalance, or, most commonly, both. Dehydration can be caused  by prolonged physical activity without adequate water intake, heat  exposure, excessive weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, blood loss,  infectious diseases, malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and very  high glucose levels. Physiologically, dehydration decreases blood  volume. The water in cells moves into the blood to compensate  for the low blood-volume, and cells shrink. Signs and symptoms  of dehydration include thirst, dizziness, fainting, headaches, low  blood-pressure, fatigue, low to no urine output, and, in extreme  cases, loss of consciousness and death. Signs and symptoms are  usually noticeable after about 2 percent of total body water is lost.  Chronic dehydration is linked to higher incidences of some  diseases. There is strong evidence that low-hydration status  increases the risk for kidney stones and exercise-induced asthma.  There is also some scientific evidence that chronic dehydration  increases the risk for kidney disease, heart disease, and the  development of hyperglycemia in people with diabetes. Older  people often suffer from chronic dehydration as their thirst  mechanism is no longer as sensitive as it used to be.  Heat Stroke  Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the  body temperature is greater than 104°F (40°C). It is the result of  the body being unable to sufficiently cool itself by thermoregulatory  mechanisms. Dehydration is a primary cause of heat stroke as there  are not enough fluids in the body to maintain adequate sweat  production, and cooling of the body is impaired. Signs and  symptoms are dry skin (absence of sweating), dizziness, trouble  breathing, rapid pulse, confusion, agitation, seizures, coma, and  possibly death. Dehydration may be preceded by heat exhaustion,  which is characterized by heavy sweating, rapid breathing, and fast  200  |  Consequences of Deficiency or Excess\n",

It is reported as the systolic pressure over the diastolic pressure,  which is the greatest and least pressure on an artery that occurs  with each heartbeat. The force of blood against an artery is  measured with a device called a sphygmomanometer. The results  are recorded in millimeters of mercury, or mmHg. A desirable blood  pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg. Hypertension is the scientific  term for high blood pressure and defined as a sustained blood  pressure of 130/80 mm Hg or greater.1  New ACC/AHA High Blood Pressure Guidelines Lower Definition of  Hypertension.

In this study, people on the low-sodium (1500 milligrams per day)  DASH diet had mean systolic blood pressures that were 7.1 mmHg  lower than people without hypertension not on the DASH diet.  The effect on blood pressure was greatest in participants with  hypertension at the beginning of the study who followed the DASH  diet. Their systolic blood pressures were, on average, 11.5 mmHg  lower than participants with hypertension on the control diet.6  Following the DASH diet not only reduces sodium intake, but  also increases potassium, calcium, and magnesium intake.

Caffeine intakes are  described in the following manner:  • Low–moderate intake. 130–300 milligrams per day  • Moderate intake. 200–300 milligrams per day  • High intake. 400 or more milligrams per day  The average caffeine consumption for American adults is  considered moderate at 280 milligrams per day, although it is not  uncommon for people to consume up to 600 milligrams per day.

Health Benefits  The most renowned effects of caffeine on the body are increased  alertness and delay of fatigue and sleep. How does caffeine  stimulate the brain? Caffeine is chemically similar to a chemical in  our brains (adenosine). Caffeine interacts with adenosine’s specific  protein receptor. It blocks the actions of the adenosine, and affects  the levels of signaling molecules in the brain, leading to an increase  in energy metabolism. At the molecular level, caffeine stimulates the  brain, increasing alertness and causing a delay of fatigue and sleep.  At high doses caffeine stimulates the motor cortex of the brain and  interferes with the sleep-wake cycle, causing side effects such as  shakiness, anxiety, and insomnia. People’s sensitivity to the adverse  effects of caffeine varies and some people develop side effects at  much lower doses. The many effects caffeine has on the brain do  not diminish with habitual drinking of caffeinated beverages.  Tools for Change  Consuming caffeine in the evening and in the middle of the night  will help keep you awake to study for an exam, but it will not  enhance your performance on the next day’s test if you do not get  enough sleep. Drink caffeinated beverages in moderation at any  time of the day or evening to increase alertness (if you are not  sensitive to caffeine’s adverse effects), but get the recommended  amount of sleep.  It is important to note that caffeine has some effects on health  that are either promoted or masked by the other beneficial  218  |  Popular Beverage Choices\n",

There is scientific evidence supporting that higher consumption of  caffeine, mostly in the form of coffee, substantially reduces the risk  for developing Type 2 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. There is a  lesser amount of evidence suggesting increased coffee consumption  lowers the risk of heart attacks in both men and women, and strokes  in women. In smaller population studies, decaffeinated coffee  sometimes performs as well as caffeinated coffee, bringing up the  hypothesis that there are beneficial chemicals in coffee other than  caffeine that play larger roles in the health benefits of coffee.

Men who did not consume coffee  had a five times more likely chance of Parkinson’s disease than men  who consumed more than 3 cups of coffee daily.2  In this study other caffeine sources, such as soft drinks and tea,  were also associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson’s disease.

There is also some scientific evidence that  drinking coffee is linked to a much lower risk for dementia and  Alzheimer’s disease.4  Health Consequences  The acute adverse health effects of caffeine ingestion are anxiety,  shakiness, and sleep deprivation. On a more chronic basis, some  scientific reports suggest that higher caffeine intake is linked to  negative effects on heart health and increased cardiovascular  disease; although at this point most data suggests caffeine does  not significantly increase either.

            "There is no good evidence that chronic caffeine exposure  increases  blood  pressure  chronically  in  people  without  hypertension.  Some have hypothesized that caffeine elevates calcium excretion  and therefore could potentially harm bones. The scientific  consensus at this time is that caffeine minimally affects calcium  levels and intake is not associated with any increased risk for  osteoporosis or the incidence of fractures in most women. Although  the effect of caffeine on calcium excretion is small, postmenopausal  women with risk factors for osteoporosis may want to make sure  their dietary caffeine intake is low or moderate and not excessive.  The Caffeine Myth  A diuretic refers to any substance that elevates the normal urine  output above that of drinking water. Caffeinated beverages are  commonly believed to be dehydrating due to their diuretic effect,  but results from scientific studies do not support that caffeinated  beverages increase urine output more so than water. This does not  mean that consuming caffeinated beverages does not affect urine  output, but rather that it does not increase urine output more than  water does. Thus, caffeinated beverages are considered a source of  hydration similar to water.  Sports Drinks  Scientific  studies  under  certain  circumstances  show  that  consuming sports drinks (instead of plain water) during high- intensity exercise lasting longer than one hour significantly  enhances endurance, and some evidence indicates it additionally  enhances performance. There is no consistent evidence that  222  |  Popular Beverage Choices\n",
            "drinking sports drinks instead of plain water enhances endurance  or performance in individuals exercising less than one hour and at  low to moderate intensities. A well-concocted sports drink contains  sugar, water, and sodium in the correct proportions so that  hydration is optimized. The sugar is helpful in maintaining blood- glucose levels needed to fuel muscles, the water keeps an athlete  hydrated, and the sodium enhances fluid absorption and replaces  some of that lost in sweat. The American College of Sports Medicine  states that the goal of drinking fluids during exercise is to prevent  dehydration, which compromises performance and endurance.  The primary source of water loss during intense physical activity  is sweat. Perspiration rates are variable and dependent on many  factors including body composition, humidity, temperature, and  type of exercise. The hydration goal for obtaining optimal  endurance and performance is to replace what is lost, not to over- hydrate. A person’s sweating rate can be approximated by  measuring weight before and after exercise—the difference in  weight will be the amount of water weight you lost.  The primary electrolyte lost in sweat is sodium. One liter of sweat  can contain between 1,000–2,000 milligrams of sodium. Potassium,  magnesium, and calcium are also lost, but in much lower amounts. If  you are exercising at high intensity for greater than ninety minutes,  it is important to replace sodium as well as water. This can be partly  accomplished by consuming a sports drink. The highest content of  sodium in commercial sports drinks is approximately 450 milligrams  per liter and thus will not replace all lost sodium unless a person  drinks several liters. This is NOT recommended, as water  intoxication not only compromises performance, but may also be  deadly. The sodium in sports drinks enhances fluid absorption so  that rehydration is more efficiently accomplished. If you are not  exercising for more than ninety minutes at a high intensity, dietary  intake of sodium and other electrolytes should be sufficient for  replacing lost electrolytes.

            "Who Needs Sports Drinks?  Children and adult athletes exercising for more than one hour at  high-intensity (tennis, rowing, rugby, soccer, etc.) may benefit  endurance-wise and possibly performance-wise from consuming a  sports drink rather than water. However, consuming sports drinks  provides no benefit over water to endurance, performance, or  exercise recovery for those exercising less than an hour. In fact, as  with all other sugary drinks containing few to no nutrients, they are  only another source of calories. Drinking sports drinks when you  are doing no exercise at all is not recommended.  Sports Drink Alternatives  Instead of a sports drink, you can replenish lost fluids and obtain  energy and electrolytes during exercise by drinking plain water and  eating a sports bar or snack that contains carbohydrates, protein,  and electrolytes. Post-exercise, low-fat milk has been scientifically  shown to be just as effective as a sports drink as a rehydration  beverage and it is more nutrient-dense, containing carbohydrates,  protein, and electrolytes, in addition to other vitamins.  The Bottom Line  Sports drinks consumed in excess by athletes or used by non- athletes simply are another source of added sugars, and thus extra  calories, in the diet and provide no performance, exercise recovery  or health benefit.  224  |  Popular Beverage Choices\n",

For  example, mashed kalo or poi was a staple to meals for Hawaiians.  Research suggests that almost 78 percent of the diet was made up  of these fiber rich carbohydrate foods.1  Carbohydrates are the perfect nutrient to meet your body’s  nutritional needs. They nourish your brain and nervous system,  provide energy to all of your cells when within proper caloric limits,  and help keep your body fit and lean.

            "Carbohydrat es are broken  down into  the  subgroups  simple and  complex  carbohydrate s. These  subgroups  are further  categorized  into mono-,  di-, and  polysacchari des.  indigestible carbohydrates provide a good amount of fiber with a  host of other health benefits.  Plants synthesize the fast-releasing carbohydrate, glucose, from  carbon dioxide in the air and water, and by harnessing the sun’s  energy. Recall that plants convert the energy in sunlight to chemical  energy in the molecule, glucose. Plants use glucose to make other  larger, more slow-releasing carbohydrates. When we eat plants we  harvest the energy of glucose to support life’s processes.  Figure 4.1 Carbohydrate Classification Scheme  Carbohydrates are a group of organic compounds containing a ratio  of one carbon atom to two hydrogen atoms to one oxygen atom.  Basically, they are hydrated carbons. The word “carbo” means  carbon and “hydrate” means water. Glucose, the most abundant  carbohydrate in the human body, has six carbon atoms, twelve  hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen atoms. The chemical formula for  glucose is written as C6H12O6. Synonymous with the term  carbohydrate is the Greek word “saccharide,” which means sugar.  The simplest unit of a carbohydrate is a monosaccharide.  Carbohydrates are broadly classified into two subgroups, simple  (“fast-releasing”)  and  complex  (“slow-releasing”).  Simple  Introduction  |  231\n",
            "carbohydrates are further grouped into the monosaccharides and  disaccharides.  Complex  carbohydrates  are  long  chains  of  monosaccharides.  Simple/Fast-Releasing Carbohydrates  Simple carbohydrates are also known more simply as “sugars” and  are  grouped  as  either  monosaccharides  or  disaccharides.  Monosaccharides include glucose, fructose, and galactose, and the  disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose.  Simple carbohydrates stimulate the sweetness taste sensation,  which is the most sensitive of all taste sensations. Even extremely  low concentrations of sugars in foods will stimulate the sweetness  taste  sensation.  Sweetness  varies  between  the  different  carbohydrate types—some are much sweeter than others. Fructose  is the top naturally-occurring sugar in sweetness value.  Monosaccharides  For all organisms from bacteria to plants to animals, glucose is the  preferred fuel source. The brain is completely dependent on glucose  as its energy source (except during extreme starvation conditions).  The monosaccharide galactose differs from glucose only in that a  hydroxyl (−OH) group faces in a different direction on the number  four carbon (Figure 4.2 “Structures of the Three Most Common  Monosaccharides: Glucose, Galactose, and Fructose”). This small  structural alteration causes galactose to be less stable than glucose.  As a result, the liver rapidly converts it to glucose. Most absorbed  galactose is utilized for energy production in cells after its  conversion to glucose. (Galactose is one of two simple sugars that  232  |  Introduction\n",

Fructose also has the same chemical formula as glucose but  differs in its chemical structure. The fructose ring contains 4  carbons while the glucose ring contains 5 carbons. Fructose, in  contrast to glucose, is not an energy source for other cells in the  body. Mostly found in fruits, honey, and sugarcane, fructose is one  of the most common monosaccharides in nature. It is also found  in soft drinks, cereals, and other products sweetened with high  fructose corn syrup.  Figure  4.2  Structures  of  the  Three  Most  Common  Monosaccharides: Glucose, Galactose, and Fructose  Pentoses are less common monosaccharides which have only five  carbons and not six. The pentoses are abundant in the nucleic acids  RNA and DNA, and also as components of fiber.  Lastly, there are the sugar alcohols, which are industrially  synthesized derivatives of monosaccharides. Some examples of  sugar alcohols are sorbitol, xylitol, and glycerol. (Xylitol is similar  in sweetness as table sugar). Sugar alcohols are often used in place  of table sugar to sweeten foods as they are incompletely digested  and absorbed, and therefore less caloric. The bacteria in your mouth  opposes them, hence sugar alcohols do not cause tooth decay.  Interestingly, the sensation of “coolness” that occurs when chewing  gum that contains sugar alcohols comes from them dissolving in the  mouth, a chemical reaction that requires heat from the inside of the  mouth.  Introduction  |  233\n",
            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  Disaccharides  Disaccharides are composed of pairs of two monosaccharides linked  together. Disaccharides include sucrose, lactose, and maltose. All of  the disaccharides contain at least one glucose molecule.  Sucrose, which contains both glucose and fructose molecules,  is otherwise known as table sugar. Sucrose is also found in many  fruits and vegetables, and at high concentrations in sugar beets  and sugarcane, which are used to make table sugar. Lactose, which  is commonly known as milk sugar, is composed of one glucose  unit and one galactose unit. Lactose is prevalent in dairy products  such as milk, yogurt, and cheese. Maltose consists of two glucose  molecules bonded together. It is a common breakdown product of  plant starches and is rarely found in foods as a disaccharide.  Figure 4.3 The Most Common Disaccharides  234  |  Introduction\n",
            "Complex/Slow-Releasing Carbohydrates  Complex carbohydrates are polysaccharides, long chains of  monosaccharides that may be branched or not branched. There are  two main groups of polysaccharides: starches and fibers.  Starches  Starch molecules are found in abundance in grains, legumes, and  root vegetables, such as potatoes. Amylose, a plant starch, is a linear  chain containing hundreds of glucose units. Amylopectin, another  plant starch, is a branched chain containing thousands of glucose  units. These large starch molecules form crystals and are the  energy-storing molecules of plants. These two starch molecules  (amylose and amylopectin) are contained together in foods, but the  smaller one, amylose, is less abundant. Eating raw foods containing  starches provides very little energy as the digestive system has a  hard time breaking them down. Cooking breaks down the crystal  structure of starches, making them much easier to break down  in the human body. The starches that remain intact throughout  digestion are called resistant starches. Bacteria in the gut can break  some of these down and may benefit gastrointestinal health.  Isolated and modified starches are used widely in the food industry  and during cooking as food thickeners.  Figure 4.4 Structures of the Plant Starches and Glycogen  Introduction  |  235\n",
            "Humans and animals store glucose energy from starches in the  form of the very large molecule, glycogen. It has many branches that  allow it to break down quickly when energy is needed by cells in the  body. It is predominantly found in liver and muscle tissue in animals.  Dietary Fibers  Dietary fibers are polysaccharides that are highly branched and  cross-linked. Some dietary fibers are pectin, gums, cellulose,  hemicellulose, and lignin. Lignin, however, is not composed of  carbohydrate units. Humans do not produce the enzymes that can  break down dietary fiber; however, bacteria in the large intestine  (colon) do. Dietary fibers are very beneficial to our health. The  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee states that there is enough  scientific evidence to support that diets high in fiber reduce the  risk for obesity and diabetes, which are primary risk factors for  cardiovascular disease.2  2. US Department of Agriculture.

            "Dietary fiber is categorized as either water-soluble or insoluble.  Some examples of soluble fibers are inulin, pectin, and guar gum  and they are found in peas, beans, oats, barley, and rye. Cellulose  and lignin are insoluble fibers and a few dietary sources of them  are whole-grain foods, flax, cauliflower, and avocados. Cellulose is  the most abundant fiber in plants, making up the cell walls and  providing structure. Soluble fibers are more easily accessible to  bacterial enzymes in the large intestine so they can be broken down  to a greater extent than insoluble fibers, but even some breakdown  of cellulose and other insoluble fibers occurs.  The last class of fiber is functional fiber. Functional fibers have  been added to foods and have been shown to provide health  benefits to humans. Functional fibers may be extracted from plants  and purified or synthetically made. An example of a functional fiber  is psyllium-seed husk. Scientific studies show that consuming  psyllium-seed husk reduces blood-cholesterol levels and this health  claim has been approved by the FDA. Total dietary fiber intake is the  sum of dietary fiber and functional fiber consumed.  Figure 4.5 Dietary Fiber  DietaryGuidelines/2010/DGAC/Report/ D-5-Carbohydrates.pdf.

Chewing, also known as mastication, crumbles the  carbohydrate foods into smaller and smaller pieces. The salivary  glands in the oral cavity secrete saliva that coats the food particles.  Saliva contains the enzyme, salivary amylase. This enzyme breaks  the bonds between the monomeric sugar units of disaccharides,  oligosaccharides, and starches. The salivary amylase breaks down  amylose and amylopectin into smaller chains of glucose, called  dextrins and maltose. The increased concentration of maltose in the  mouth that results from the mechanical and chemical breakdown  of starches in whole grains is what enhances their sweetness. Only  about five percent of starches are broken down in the mouth. (This  is a good thing as more glucose in the mouth would lead to more  tooth decay.) When carbohydrates reach the stomach no further  chemical breakdown occurs because the amylase enzyme does not  function in the acidic conditions of the stomach. But mechanical  breakdown is ongoing—the strong peristaltic contractions of the  stomach mix the carbohydrates into the more uniform mixture of  chyme.  Figure 4.6 Salivary Glands in the Mouth  240  |  Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates\n",

From the Stomach to the Small Intestine  The chyme is gradually expelled into the upper part of the small  intestine. Upon entry of the chyme into the small intestine, the  pancreas releases pancreatic juice through a duct. This pancreatic  juice contains the enzyme, pancreatic amylase, which starts again  the breakdown of dextrins into shorter and shorter carbohydrate  chains. Additionally, enzymes are secreted by the intestinal cells  that line the villi. These enzymes, known collectively as  disaccharidase, are sucrase, maltase, and lactase. Sucrase breaks  sucrose into glucose and fructose molecules. Maltase breaks the  bond between the two glucose units of maltose, and lactase breaks  the bond between galactose and glucose. Once carbohydrates are  Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates  |  241\n",

When people do not have enough of the enzyme lactase, lactose is  not sufficiently broken down resulting in a condition called lactose  intolerance. The undigested lactose moves to the large intestine  where bacteria are able to digest it. The bacterial digestion of  lactose produces gases leading to symptoms of diarrhea, bloating,  and abdominal cramps. Lactose intolerance usually occurs in adults  and is associated with race. The National Digestive Diseases  Information Clearing House states that African Americans, Hispanic  Americans, American Indians, and Asian Americans have much  higher incidences of lactose intolerance while those of northern  European descent have the least.1 Most people with lactose  intolerance can tolerate some amount of dairy products in their  diet. The severity of the symptoms depends on how much lactose is  consumed and the degree of lactase deficiency.  Absorption: Going to the Blood Stream  The cells in the small intestine have membranes that contain many  transport proteins in order to get the monosaccharides and other  nutrients into the blood where they can be distributed to the rest of  the body. The first organ to receive glucose, fructose, and galactose  is the liver. The liver takes them up and converts galactose to  glucose, breaks fructose into even smaller carbon-containing units,  1. Lactose Intolerance.

Figure 4.7 Carbohydrate Digestion  Maintaining Blood Glucose Levels: The Pancreas  and Liver  Glucose levels in the blood are tightly controlled, as having either  too much or too little glucose in the blood can have health  consequences. Glucose regulates its levels in the blood via a process  called negative feedback. An everyday example of negative feedback  is in your oven because it contains a thermostat. When you set  the temperature to cook a delicious homemade noodle casserole  at 375°F the thermostat senses the temperature and sends an  electrical signal to turn the elements on and heat up the oven.

After eating a meal containing  carbohydrates glucose levels rise in the blood.  Insulin-secreting cells in the pancreas sense the increase in blood  glucose and release the hormone, insulin, into the blood. Insulin  sends a signal to the body’s cells to remove glucose from the blood  by transporting it into different organ cells around the body and  using it to make energy. In the case of muscle tissue and the liver,  insulin sends the biological message to store glucose away as  glycogen. The presence of insulin in the blood signifies to the body  that glucose is available for fuel. As glucose is transported into the  cells around the body, the blood glucose levels decrease. Insulin has  an opposing hormone called glucagon. Glucagon-secreting cells in  the pancreas sense the drop in glucose and, in response, release  glucagon into the blood. Glucagon communicates to the cells in the  body to stop using all the glucose. More specifically, it signals the  liver to break down glycogen and release the stored glucose into the  blood, so that glucose levels stay within the target range and all cells  get the needed fuel to function properly.

Some of the remaining indigestible carbohydrates are broken  down by enzymes released by bacteria in the large intestine. The  products  of  bacterial  digestion  of  these  slow-releasing  carbohydrates are short-chain fatty acids and some gases. The  short-chain fatty acids are either used by the bacteria to make  energy and grow, are eliminated in the feces, or are absorbed into  cells of the colon, with a small amount being transported to the  liver. Colonic cells use the short-chain fatty acids to support some  of their functions. The liver can also metabolize the short-chain  fatty acids into cellular energy.

Since dietary  fiber is digested much less in the gastrointestinal tract than other  carbohydrate types (simple sugars, many starches) the rise in blood  glucose after eating them is less, and slower.

The type of carbohydrate within a food affects the GI along with  its fat and fiber content. Increased fat and fiber in foods increases  the time required for digestion and delays the rate of gastric  emptying into the small intestine which, ultimately reduces the GI.  Processing and cooking also affects a food’s GI by increasing their  digestibility. Advancements in the technologies of food processing  and the high consumer demand for convenient, precooked foods in  the United States has created foods that are digested and absorbed  more rapidly, independent of the fiber content. Modern breakfast  cereals, breads, pastas, and many prepared foods have a high GI.  In contrast, most raw foods have a lower GI. (However, the more  ripened a fruit or vegetable is, the higher its GI.)  The GI can be used as a guide for choosing healthier carbohydrate  choices but has some limitations. The first is GI does not take into  account the amount of carbohydrates in a portion of food, only the  type of carbohydrate. Another is that combining low- and high-GI  foods changes the GI for the meal. Also, some nutrient-dense foods  have higher GIs than less nutritious food. (For instance, oatmeal has  a higher GI than chocolate because the fat content of chocolate is  higher.) Lastly, meats and fats do not have a GI since they do not  contain carbohydrates.  250  |  Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates\n",

            "The Functions of  Carbohydrates in the Body  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  There are five primary functions of carbohydrates in the human  body. They are energy production, energy storage, building  macromolecules, sparing protein, and assisting in lipid metabolism.  Energy Production  The primary role of carbohydrates is to supply energy to all cells  in the body. Many cells prefer glucose as a source of energy versus  other compounds like fatty acids. Some cells, such as red blood  cells, are only able to produce cellular energy from glucose. The  brain is also highly sensitive to low blood-glucose levels because  it uses only glucose to produce energy and function (unless under  extreme starvation conditions). About 70 percent of the glucose  entering the body from digestion is redistributed (by the liver) back  into the blood for use by other tissues. Cells that require energy  remove the glucose from the blood with a transport protein in their  membranes. The energy from glucose comes from the chemical  bonds between the carbon atoms. Sunlight energy was required to  produce these high-energy bonds in the process of photosynthesis.  Cells in our bodies break these bonds and capture the energy to  perform cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is basically a  controlled burning of glucose versus an uncontrolled burning. A cell  uses many chemical reactions in multiple enzymatic steps to slow  the release of energy (no explosion) and more efficiently capture the  energy held within the chemical bonds in glucose.  The Functions of Carbohydrates in the Body  |  253\n",
            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  The first stage in the breakdown of glucose is called glycolysis.  Glycolysis, or the splitting of glucose, occurs in an intricate series  of ten enzymatic-reaction steps. The second stage of glucose  breakdown occurs in the energy factory organelles, called  mitochondria. One carbon atom and two oxygen atoms are  removed, yielding more energy. The energy from these carbon  bonds is carried to another area of the mitochondria, making the  cellular energy available in a form cells can use.  Figure 4.10 Cellular Respiration    Cellular respiration is the process by which energy is captured from  glucose.  Energy Storage  If the body already has enough energy to support its functions, the  excess glucose is stored as glycogen (the majority of which is stored  in the muscles and liver). A molecule of glycogen may contain in  254  |  The Functions of Carbohydrates in the Body\n",
            "excess of fifty thousand single glucose units and is highly branched,  allowing for the rapid dissemination of glucose when it is needed to  make cellular energy.  The amount of glycogen in the body at any one time is equivalent  to about 4,000 kilocalories—3,000 in muscle tissue and 1,000 in the  liver. Prolonged muscle use (such as exercise for longer than a few  hours) can deplete the glycogen energy reserve. Remember that this  is referred to as “hitting the wall” or “bonking” and is characterized  by fatigue and a decrease in exercise performance. The weakening  of muscles sets in because it takes longer to transform the chemical  energy in fatty acids and proteins to usable energy than glucose.  After prolonged exercise, glycogen is gone and muscles must rely  more on lipids and proteins as an energy source. Athletes can  increase their glycogen reserve modestly by reducing training  intensity and increasing their carbohydrate intake to between 60  and 70 percent of total calories three to five days prior to an event.  People who are not hardcore training and choose to run a  5-kilometer race for fun do not need to consume a big plate of  pasta prior to a race since without long-term intense training the  adaptation of increased muscle glycogen will not happen.  The liver, like muscle, can store glucose energy as a glycogen,  but in contrast to muscle tissue it will sacrifice its stored glucose  energy to other tissues in the body when blood glucose is low.  Approximately one-quarter of total body glycogen content is in the  liver (which is equivalent to about a four-hour supply of glucose)  but this is highly dependent on activity level. The liver uses this  glycogen reserve as a way to keep blood-glucose levels within a  narrow range between meal times. When the liver’s glycogen supply  is exhausted, glucose is made from amino acids obtained from the  destruction of proteins in order to maintain metabolic homeostasis.

Image  by rozeta /  CC BY-SA  3.0  Building Macromolecules  Although most absorbed glucose is used to make energy, some  glucose is converted to ribose and deoxyribose, which are essential  building blocks of important macromolecules, such as RNA, DNA,  and ATP. Glucose is additionally utilized to make the molecule  NADPH, which is important for protection against oxidative stress  and is used in many other chemical reactions in the body. If all of the  energy, glycogen-storing capacity, and building needs of the body  are met, excess glucose can be used to make fat. This is why a diet  too high in carbohydrates and calories can add on the fat pounds—a  topic that will be discussed shortly.

Because there is  no storage molecule of amino acids, this process requires the  destruction of proteins, primarily from muscle tissue. The presence  of adequate glucose basically spares the breakdown of proteins  from being used to make glucose needed by the body.  Lipid Metabolism  As blood-glucose levels rise, the use of lipids as an energy source is  The Functions of Carbohydrates in the Body  |  257\n",
            "inhibited. Thus, glucose additionally has a “fat-sparing” effect. This  is because an increase in blood glucose stimulates release of the  hormone insulin, which tells cells to use glucose (instead of lipids) to  make energy. Adequate glucose levels in the blood also prevent the  development of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic condition resulting  from an elevation of ketone bodies in the blood. Ketone bodies are  an alternative energy source that cells can use when glucose supply  is insufficient, such as during fasting. Ketone bodies are acidic and  high elevations in the blood can cause it to become too acidic. This  is rare in healthy adults, but can occur in alcoholics, people who  are malnourished, and in individuals who have Type 1 diabetes. The  minimum amount of carbohydrate in the diet required to inhibit  ketosis in adults is 50 grams per day.  Carbohydrates  are  critical  to  support  life’s  most  basic  function—the production of energy. Without energy none of the  other life processes are performed. Although our bodies can  synthesize glucose it comes at the cost of protein destruction. As  with all nutrients though, carbohydrates are to be consumed in  moderation as having too much or too little in the diet may lead to  health problems.

This is a hotly debated topic  by both the scientific community and the general public. In this  section, we will give a brief overview of the scientific evidence.

            "The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine (IOM)  defines added sugars as “sugars and syrups that are added to foods  during processing or preparation.” The IOM goes on to state, “Major  sources of added sugars include soft drinks, sports drinks, cakes,  cookies, pies, fruitades, fruit punch, dairy desserts, and candy.”  Processed foods, even microwaveable dinners, also contain added  sugars. Added sugars do not include sugars that occur naturally  in whole foods (such as an apple), but do include natural sugars  such as brown sugar, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, fruit juice  concentrates, maple syrup, sucrose, and raw sugar that are then  added to create other foods (such as cookies). Results from a survey  of forty-two thousand Americans reports that in 2008 the average  intake of added sugars is 15 percent of total calories, a drop from 18  percent of total calories in 2000.1  This is still above the recommended intake of less than 10 percent  of total calories. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports  that sugar consumption in the American diet in 2008 was, on  average, 28 teaspoons per day (Figure 4.13 “Sugar Consumption (in  Teaspoons) from Various Sources”).  Obesity, Diabetes, and Heart Disease and Their  Hypothesized Link to Excessive Sugar and  Refined Carbohydrate Consumption  To understand the magnitude of the health problem in the United  1. Welsh JA, Sharma AJ, et al.

            "States consider this—in the United States approximately 130 million  adults are overweight, and 30 percent of them are considered  obese. The obesity epidemic has reached young adults and children  and will markedly affect the prevalence of serious health  consequences in adulthood. Health consequences linked to being  overweight or obese include Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular  disease, arthritis, depression, and some cancers. An infatuation with  sugary foods and refined grains likely contributes to the epidemic  proportion of people who are overweight or obese in this country,  but so do the consumption of high-calorie foods that contain too  much saturated fat and the sedentary lifestyle of most Americans.  There is much disagreement over whether high-carbohydrate diets  increase weight-gain and disease risk, especially when calories are  not significantly higher between compared diets. Many scientific  studies demonstrate positive correlations between diets high in  added sugars with weight gain and disease risk, but some others do  not show a significant relationship. In regard to refined grains, there  are no studies that show consumption of refined grains increases  weight gain or disease risk. What is clear, however, is that getting  more of your carbohydrates from dietary sources containing whole  grains instead of refined grains stimulates weight loss and reduces  disease risk.  A major source of added sugars in the American diet is soft drinks.  There is consistent scientific evidence that consuming sugary soft  drinks increases weight gain and disease risk. An analysis of over  thirty studies in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition  concluded that there is much evidence to indicate higher  consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is linked with weight  gain and obesity.2 A study at the Harvard School of Public Health  2. Malik VS, Schulze MB, Hu FB.

After its 2010 scientific  conference on added sugars, the AHA made the following related  dietary recommendations4:  • First, know the number of total calories you should eat each  day.  • Consume an overall healthy diet and get the most nutrients for  the calories, using foods high in added sugars as discretionary  calories (those left over after getting all recommended  nutrients subtracted from the calories used).  • Lower sugar intake, especially when the sugars in foods are not  tied to positive nutrients such as in sugary drinks, candies,  cakes, and cookies.  274–88. http:/ /www.ajcn.org/content/84/2/274.long.

            "• Focus on calories in certain food categories such as beverages  and confections, and encourage consumption of positive  nutrients and foods such as cereals and low-fat or fat-free  dairy products.  The Most Notorious Sugar  Before high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) was marketed as the best  food and beverage sweetener, sucrose (table sugar) was the  number-one sweetener in America. (Recall that sucrose, or table  sugar, is a disaccharide consisting of one glucose unit and one  fructose unit.) HFCS also contains the simple sugars fructose and  glucose, but with fructose at a slightly higher concentration. In  the production of HFCS, corn starch is broken down to glucose,  and some of the glucose is then converted to fructose. Fructose  is sweeter than glucose; hence many food manufacturers choose  to sweeten foods with HFCS. HFCS is used as a sweetener for  carbonated beverages, condiments, cereals, and a great variety of  other processed foods.  Some scientists, public health personnel, and healthcare  providers believe that fructose is the cause of the obesity epidemic  and its associated health consequences. The majority of their  evidence stems from the observation that since the early 1970s  the number of overweight or obese Americans has dramatically  increased and so has the consumption of foods containing HFCS.  However, as discussed, so has the consumption of added sugars  in general. Animal studies that fuel the fructose opponents show  fructose is not used to produce energy in the body; instead it is  mostly converted to fat in the liver—potentially contributing to  insulin resistance and the development of Type 2 diabetes.  Additionally, fructose does not stimulate the release of certain  appetite-suppressing hormones, like insulin, as glucose does. Thus,  264  |  Health Consequences and Benefits of High-Carbohydrate Diets\n",
            "a diet high in fructose could potentially stimulate fat deposition and  weight gain.  In human studies, excessive fructose intake has sometimes been  associated with weight gain, but results are inconsistent. Moderate  fructose intake is not associated with weight gain at all. Moreover,  other studies show that some fructose in the diet actually improves  glucose metabolism especially in people with Type 2 diabetes.5  In fact, people with diabetes were once advised to use fructose  as an alternative sweetener to table sugar. Overall, there is no good  evidence that moderate fructose consumption contributes to  weight gain and chronic disease. At this time conclusive evidence  is not available on whether fructose is any worse than any other  added sugar in increasing the risk for obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and  cardiovascular disease.  Do Low-Carbohydrate Diets Affect Health?  Since the early 1990s, marketers of low-carbohydrate diets have  bombarded us with the idea that eating fewer carbohydrates  promotes weight loss and that these diets are superior to others in  their effects on weight loss and overall health. The most famous of  these low-carbohydrate diets is the Atkins diet. Others include the  “South Beach” diet, the “Zone” diet, and the “Earth” diet. Despite the  claims these diets make, there is little scientific evidence to support  that low-carbohydrate diets are significantly better than other diets  in promoting long-term weight loss. A study in The Nutritional  5. Elliott SS, Keim NL, et al. (2002). Fructose, Weight Gain,  and the Insulin Resistance Syndrome.

The overall  scientific consensus is that consuming fewer calories in a balanced  diet will promote health and stimulate weight loss, with significantly  better results achieved when combined with regular exercise.  Health Benefits of Whole Grains in the Diet  While excessive consumption of simple carbohydrates is potentially  bad for your health, consuming more complex carbohydrates is  extremely beneficial to health. There is a wealth of scientific  evidence supporting that replacing refined grains with whole grains  decreases the risk for obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular  disease.

Now that we know the benefits of eating the right  carbohydrate, we will examine exactly how much should be eaten to  promote health and prevent disease.  How Many Carbohydrates Does a Person Need?  The Food and Nutrition Board of IOM has set the Recommended  Dietary Allowance (RDA) of carbohydrates for children and adults  at 130 grams per day. This is the average minimum amount the  brain requires to function properly. The Acceptable Macronutrient  Distribution Range (AMDR) for carbohydrates is between 45 and  65 percent of your total caloric daily intake. This means that on  a 2,000 kilocalorie diet, a person should consume between 225  and 325 grams of carbohydrate each day. According to the IOM  not more than 25 percent of total calories consumed should come  from added sugars. The World Health Organization and the AHA  recommend much lower intakes of added sugars—10 percent or less  of total calories consumed. The IOM has also set Adequate Intakes  for dietary fiber, which are 38 and 25 grams for men and women,  respectively. The recommendations for dietary fiber are based upon  the intake levels known to prevent against heart disease.

Fast-releasing carbohydrates are also  found in large amounts in processed foods, soft drinks, and sweets.

            "September 27, 2017.  It’s the Whole Nutrient Package  In choosing dietary sources of carbohydrates the best ones are  those that are nutrient dense, meaning they contain more essential  nutrients per calorie of energy. In general, nutrient-dense  carbohydrates are minimally processed and include whole-grain  breads and cereals, low-fat dairy products, fruits, vegetables, and  beans. In contrast, empty-calorie carbohydrate foods are highly  processed and often contain added sugars and fats. Soft drinks,  cakes, cookies, and candy are examples of empty-calorie  carbohydrates.  They  are  sometimes  referred  to  as  ‘bad  carbohydrates,’ as they are known to cause health problems when  consumed in excess.  Understanding Carbohydrates from Product  Information  While nutrition facts labels aid in determining the amount of  carbohydrates you eat, they do not help in determining whether  a food is refined or not. The ingredients list provides some help  in this regard. It identifies all of the food’s ingredients in order of  concentration, with the most concentrated ingredient first. When  choosing between two breads, pick the one that lists whole wheat  (not wheat flour) as the first ingredient, and avoid those with other  flour ingredients, such as white flour or corn flour. (Enriched wheat  flour refers to white flour with added vitamins.) Eat less of products  that list HFCS and other sugars such as sucrose, honey, dextrose,  and cane sugar in the first five ingredients. If you want to eat less  processed foods then, in general, stay away from products with  274  |  Carbohydrates and Personal Diet Choices\n",

The Nutrition and Labeling Act of 1990  has defined for the food industry and consumers what these labels  mean (Table 4.4 “Food Labels Pertaining to Carbohydrates”).  Table 4.4 Food Labels Pertaining to Carbohydrates  Label  Meaning  Sugar-free  Contains less than 0.5 grams of sugar per serving  Reduced  sugar  Contains 25 percent less sugar than similar product  Less sugar  Contains 25 percent less sugar than similar product, and  was not altered by processing to become so  No sugars  added  No sugars added during processing  High fiber  Contains at least 20 percent of daily value of fiber in each  serving  A good  source of  fiber  Contains between 10 and 19 percent of the daily value of  fiber per serving  More fiber  Contains 10 percent or more of the daily value of fiber per  serving  Source: Appendix A: Definitions of Nutrient Claims.

            "Personal Choices  Carbohydrates are in most foods so you have a great variety of  choices with which to meet the carbohydrates recommendations  for a healthy diet. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines recommends eating  more unrefined carbohydrates and more fiber, and reducing  consumption of foods that are high in added sugars. To accomplish  these recommendations use some or all of the following  suggestions:  • Get more daily carbohydrate servings from whole grains by  eating a whole-grain cereal for breakfast, using whole-grain  bread to make a sandwich for lunch, and eating a serving of  beans and/or nuts with dinner.  • Make sure to get at least three servings (or more) of all the  grains you eat as whole grains every day. A serving of whole  grains is equal to one slice of whole-wheat bread, one ounce of  whole-grain cereal, and one-half cup of cooked cereal, brown  rice, or whole-wheat pasta.  Food products made with cornmeal use the whole grain so  choose tortillas, corn cereals, and corn breads with cornmeal  listed as the first ingredient.  • When baking, substitute whole-wheat flour or other whole- grain flour for some of the refined white flour.  • If you like bread at dinner, choose a whole-grain muffin over a  Kaiser roll or baguette.  Add beans, nuts, or seeds to salad—they add texture and taste.  • Choose whole-grain pastas and brown rice, cook al dente, and  add some beans and vegetables in equal portions.  • Change it up a bit and experience the taste and satisfaction of  other whole grains such as barley, quinoa, and bulgur.  • Eat snacks high in fiber, such as almonds, pistachios, raisins,  and air-popped popcorn.  Add an artichoke and green peas to your dinner plate more  276  |  Carbohydrates and Personal Diet Choices\n",

The Food Industry: Functional Attributes of  Carbohydrates and the Use of Sugar Substitutes  In the food industry, both fast-releasing and slow-releasing  carbohydrates are utilized to give foods a wide spectrum of  functional attributes, including increased sweetness, viscosity, bulk,  coating ability, solubility, consistency, texture, body, and browning  capacity. The differences in chemical structure between the  different carbohydrates confer their varied functional uses in foods.  Starches, gums, and pectins are used as thickening agents in making  jam, cakes, cookies, noodles, canned products, imitation cheeses,  and a variety of other foods. Molecular gastronomists use slow- releasing carbohydrates, such as alginate, to give shape and texture  to their fascinating food creations. Adding fiber to foods increases  bulk. Simple sugars are used not only for adding sweetness, but  also to add texture, consistency, and browning. In ice cream, the  combination of sucrose and corn syrup imparts sweetness as well as  a glossy appearance and smooth texture.  Due to the potential health consequences of consuming too many  added sugars, sugar substitutes have replaced them in many foods  and beverages. Sugar substitutes may be from natural sources or  artificially made. Those that are artificially made are called artificial  sweeteners and must be approved by the FDA for use in foods  and beverages. The artificial sweeteners approved by the FDA are  saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, neotame, advantame,  and sucralose. Stevia is an example of a naturally derived sugar  substitute. It comes from a plant commonly known as sugarleaf  Carbohydrates and Personal Diet Choices  |  277\n",
            "and does not require FDA approval. Sugar alcohols, such as xylitol,  sorbitol, erythritol, and mannitol, are sugar alcohols that occur  naturally in some fruits and vegetables. However, they are  industrially synthesized with yeast and other microbes for use as  food additives. The FDA requires that foods disclose the fact that  they contain sugar alcohols, but does not require scientific testing  of it. (Though many of them have undergone studies anyway.) In  comparison to sucrose, artificial sweeteners are significantly  sweeter (in fact, by several hundred times), but sugar alcohols are  more often less sweet than sucrose (see Table 4.5 “Relative  Sweetness of Sugar Substitutes”). Artificial sweeteners and Stevia  are not digested or absorbed in significant amounts and therefore  are not a significant source of calories in the diet. Sugar alcohols  are somewhat digested and absorbed and, on average, contribute  about half of the calories as sucrose (4 kilocalories/gram). These  attributes  make  sugar  substitutes  attractive  for  many  people—especially those who want to lose weightand/or better  manage their blood-glucose levels.

            "Benefits of Sugar Substitutes  Consuming foods and beverages containing sugar substitutes may  benefit health by reducing the consumption of simple sugars, which  are higher in calories, cause tooth decay, and are potentially linked  to chronic disease. Artificial sweeteners are basically non-nutrients  though not all are completely calorie-free. However, because they  are so intense in sweetness they are added in very small amounts  to foods and beverages. Artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols are  not “fermentable sugars” and therefore they do not cause tooth  decay. Chewing gum with artificial sweeteners is the only proven  way that artificial sweeteners promote oral health. The American  Dental Association (ADA) allows manufacturers of chewing gum to  label packages with an ADA seal if they have convincing scientific  evidence demonstrating their product either reduces plaque acids,  cavities, or gum disease, or promotes tooth remineralization.  There is limited scientific evidence that consuming products with  artificial sweeteners decreases weight. In fact, some studies suggest  the intense sweetness of these products increases appetite for  sweet foods and may lead to increased weight gain. Also, there  is very limited evidence that suggests artificial sweeteners lower  blood-glucose levels. Additionally, many foods and beverages  containing artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols are still empty- calorie foods (i.e. chewing sugarless gum or drinking diet soda pop)  are not going to better your blood-glucose levels or your health.  Health Concerns  The most common side effect of consuming products containing  sugar substitutes is gastrointestinal upset, a result of their  incomplete digestion. Since the introduction of sugar substitutes to  the food and beverage markets, the public has expressed concern  Carbohydrates and Personal Diet Choices  |  279\n",
            "about their safety. The health concerns of sugar substitutes  originally  stemmed  from  scientific  studies,  which  were  misinterpreted by both scientists and the public.  In the early 1970s scientific studies were published that  demonstrated that high doses of saccharin caused bladder tumors  in rats. This information fueled the still-ongoing debate of the  health consequences of all artificial sweeteners. In actuality, the  results from the early studies were completely irrelevant to humans.  The large doses (2.5 percent of diet) of saccharine caused a pellet  to form in the rat’s bladder. That pellet chronically irritated the  bladder wall, eventually resulting in tumor development. Since this  study, scientific investigation in rats, monkeys, and humans have  not found any relationship between saccharine consumption and  bladder cancer. In 2000, saccharin was removed from the US  National Toxicology Program’s list of potential carcinogens.1  There have been health concerns over other artificial sweeteners,  most notably aspartame (sold under the trade names of NutraSweet  and Equal). The first misconception regarding aspartame was that  it was linked with an increase in the incidence of brain tumors in  the United States. It was subsequently discovered that the increase  in brain tumors started eight years prior to the introduction of  aspartame to the market. Today, aspartame is accused of causing  brain damage, autism, emotional disorders, and a myriad of other  disorders and diseases. Some even believe aspartame is part of a  governmental conspiracy to make people dumber. The reality is  there is no good scientific evidence backing any of these  accusations, and that aspartame has been the most scientifically  1. Artificial Sweeteners and Cancer.

Aspartame is made by joining aspartic acid and phenylalanine to  a dipeptide (with a methyl ester). When digested, it is broken down  to aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol. People who have the  rare genetic disorder phenylketonuria (PKU) have to avoid products  containing aspartame. Individuals who have PKU do not have a  functional enzyme that converts phenylalanine to the amino acid  tyrosine. This causes a buildup of phenylalanine and its metabolic  products in the body. If PKU is not treated, the buildup of  phenylalanine causes progressive brain damage and seizures. The  FDA requires products that contain aspartame to state on the  product label, “Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine.” For more  details on sugar substitutes please refer to Table 4.6 “Sweeteners”.

The  coconut provided wood for shelter and craftsmanship along with  being a source of hydration, animal feed and income through copra.  It also serves many ecological functions such as a source for shade,  protection from the wind, and coastal erosion control.1 A thriving  coconut tree provided Pacific Island families with great prosperity.  For many Pacific communities the coconut provided a valuable  source of fat to a diet that was generally low in fat as the major  nutrient found in the mature coconut is fat. As you read further, you  will learn the different types of fats, their essential roles in the body,  and the potential health consequences and benefits of diets rich in  particular lipids. You will be better equipped to decide the best way  to get your nutritional punch from various fats in your diet.  Lipids are important molecules that serve different roles in the  human body. A common misconception is that fat is simply  fattening. However, fat is probably the reason we are all here.  Throughout history, there have been many instances when food was  1. Snowdon W, Osborn T. (2003). Coconut: It’s role in  health. Secretariat of the Pacific.  292  |  Introduction\n",

So, normal fat reserves are a signal that metabolic processes  are efficient and a person is healthy.  Lipids are a family of organic compounds that are mostly insoluble  in water. Composed of fats and oils, lipids are molecules that yield  high energy and have a chemical composition mainly of carbon,  hydrogen, and oxygen. Lipids perform three primary biological  functions within the body: they serve as structural components of  cell membranes, function as energy storehouses, and function as  important signaling molecules.  The three main types of lipids are triglycerides, phospholipids,  and sterols. Triglycerides make up more than 95 percent of lipids  in the diet and are commonly found in fried foods, vegetable oil,  butter, whole milk, cheese, cream cheese, and some meats.  Naturally occurring triglycerides are found in many foods, including  avocados, olives, corn, and nuts. We commonly call the triglycerides  in our food “fats” and “oils.” Fats are lipids that are solid at room  temperature, whereas oils are liquid. As with most fats, triglycerides  do not dissolve in water. The terms fats, oils, and triglycerides are  discretionary and can be used interchangeably. In this chapter when  we use the word fat, we are referring to triglycerides.  Phospholipids make up only about 2 percent of dietary lipids.  They are water-soluble and are found in both plants and animals.  Phospholipids are crucial for building the protective barrier, or  membrane, around your body’s cells. In fact, phospholipids are  synthesized in the body to form cell and organelle membranes. In  blood and body fluids, phospholipids form structures in which fat is  enclosed and transported throughout the bloodstream.  Sterols are the least common type of lipid. Cholesterol is perhaps  the best well-known sterol. Though cholesterol has a notorious  reputation, the body gets only a small amount of its cholesterol  through food—the body produces most of it. Cholesterol is an  important component of the cell membrane and is required for the  synthesis of sex hormones, and bile salts.  Introduction  |  293\n",

            "The Functions of Lipids in  the Body  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Storing Energy  The excess energy from the food we eat is digested and  incorporated into adipose tissue, or fatty tissue. Most of the energy  required by the human body is provided by carbohydrates and  lipids. As discussed in the Carbohydrates chapter, glucose is stored  in the body as glycogen. While glycogen provides a ready source of  energy, lipids primarily function as an energy reserve. As you may  recall, glycogen is quite bulky with heavy water content, thus the  body cannot store too much for long. Alternatively, fats are packed  together tightly without water and store far greater amounts of  energy in a reduced space. A fat gram is densely concentrated with  energy—it contains more than double the amount of energy than a  gram of carbohydrate. Energy is needed to power the muscles for  all the physical work and play an average person or child engages in.  For instance, the stored energy in muscles propels an athlete down  the track, spurs a dancer’s legs to showcase the latest fancy steps,  and keeps all the moving parts of the body functioning smoothly.  Unlike other body cells that can store fat in limited supplies, fat  cells are specialized for fat storage and are able to expand almost  indefinitely in size. An overabundance of adipose tissue can result  in undue stress on the body and can be detrimental to your health.  A serious impact of excess fat is the accumulation of too much  cholesterol in the arterial wall, which can thicken the walls of  arteries and lead to cardiovascular disease. Thus, while some body  296  |  The Functions of Lipids in the Body\n",

Regulating and Signaling  Triglycerides control the body’s internal climate, maintaining  constant temperature. Those who don’t have enough fat in their  bodies tend to feel cold sooner, are often fatigued, and have  pressure sores on their skin from fatty acid deficiency. Triglycerides  also help the body produce and regulate hormones. For example,  adipose tissue secretes the hormone leptin, which regulates  appetite. In the reproductive system, fatty acids are required for  proper reproductive health. Women who lack proper amounts may  stop menstruating and become infertile. Omega-3 and omega-6  essential fatty acids help regulate cholesterol and blood clotting  and control inflammation in the joints, tissues, and bloodstream.  Fats also play important functional roles in sustaining nerve impulse  transmission, memory storage, and tissue structure.

It also gives the body the extra padding  required when engaging in physically demanding activities such as  ice- or roller skating, horseback riding, or snowboarding.  Aiding Digestion and Increasing Bioavailability  The dietary fats in the foods we eat break down in our digestive  systems and begin the transport of precious micronutrients. By  carrying fat-soluble nutrients through the digestive process,  intestinal absorption is improved. This improved absorption is also  known as increased bioavailability. Fat-soluble nutrients are  especially important for good health and exhibit a variety of  functions. Vitamins A, D, E, and K—the fat-soluble vitamins—are  mainly found in foods containing fat. Some fat-soluble vitamins  (such as vitamin A) are also found in naturally fat-free foods such  as green leafy vegetables, carrots, and broccoli. These vitamins are  best absorbed when combined with foods containing fat. Fats also  increase the bioavailability of compounds known as phytochemicals,  which are plant constituents such as lycopene (found in tomatoes)  and beta-carotene (found in carrots). Phytochemicals are believed  to promote health and well-being. As a result, eating tomatoes with  olive oil or salad dressing will facilitate lycopene absorption. Other  essential nutrients, such as essential fatty acids, are constituents of  the fats themselves and serve as building blocks of a cell.

Foods that are  high in fat contain more calories than foods high in protein or  carbohydrates. As a result, high-fat foods are a convenient source  of energy. For example, 1 gram of fat or oil provides 9 kilocalories  of energy, compared with 4 kilocalories found in 1 gram of  carbohydrate or protein. Depending on the level of physical activity  and on nutritional needs, fat requirements vary greatly from person  to person. When energy needs are high, the body welcomes the  high-caloric density of fats. For instance, infants and growing  children require proper amounts of fat to support normal growth  and development. If an infant or child is given a low-fat diet for  an extended period, growth and development will not progress  normally. Other individuals with high-energy needs are athletes,  people who have physically demanding jobs, and those recuperating  from illness.  When the body has used all of its calories from carbohydrates  (this can occur after just twenty minutes of exercise), it initiates  fat usage. A professional swimmer must consume large amounts of  food energy to meet the demands of swimming long distances, so  eating fat-rich foods makes sense. In contrast, if a person who leads  a sedentary lifestyle eats the same high-density fat foods, they will  intake more fat calories than their body requires within just a few  bites. Use caution—consumption of calories over and beyond energy  requirements is a contributing factor to obesity.  The Role of Lipids in Food  |  301\n",

Frying foods locks in flavor and lessens  cooking time. How long does it take you to recall the smell of your  favorite food cooking? What would a meal be without that savory  aroma to delight your senses and heighten your preparedness for  eating a meal?  Fat plays another valuable role in nutrition. Fat contributes to  satiety, or the sensation of fullness. When fatty foods are swallowed  the body responds by enabling the processes controlling digestion  to retard the movement of food along the digestive tract, thus  promoting an overall sense of fullness. Oftentimes before the feeling  of fullness arrives, people overindulge in fat-rich foods, finding the  delectable taste irresistible. Indeed, the very things that make fat- rich foods attractive also make them a hindrance to maintaining a  healthful diet.  302  |  The Role of Lipids in Food\n",

Research suggests  that a diet that is too high in omega-6 fats distorts the  balance of proinflammatory agents, promoting chronic  inflammation and causing the potential for health problems  such as asthma, arthritis, allergies, or diabetes. Omega-6  fats compete with omega-3 fats for enzymes and will  actually replace omega-3 fats. The typical western diet is  characterized by an excessive consumption of foods high in  omega-6 fatty acids.

As we discuss the  various types of lipids (triglycerides, phospholipids, and sterols) in  further detail, we will compare their structures and functions and  examine their impact on human health.  Triglycerides Structure and Functions  Triglycerides are the main form of lipid found in the body and in the  diet. Fatty acids and glycerol are the building blocks of triglycerides.  Glycerol is a thick, smooth, syrupy compound that is often used  in the food industry. To form a triglyceride, a glycerol molecule  is joined by three fatty acid chains. triglycerides contain varying  mixtures of fatty acids.

Fatty acids consist of a carboxylic acid (−COOH) group  on one end of a carbon chain and a methyl group (−CH3) on the  other end. Fatty acids can differ from one another in two important  ways—carbon chain length and degree of saturation.  It’s All in the Chain  Fatty acids have different chain lengths and different compositions.  Foods have fatty acids with chain lengths between four and twenty- four carbons and most of them contain an even number of carbon  atoms. When the carbon chain length is shorter, the melting point  of the fatty acid becomes lower—and the fatty acid becomes more  liquid.

The term saturation refers  to whether or not a fatty acid chain is filled (or “saturated”) to  capacity with hydrogen atoms. If each available carbon bond holds  a hydrogen atom we call this a saturated fatty acid chain. All carbon  atoms in such a fatty acid chain are bonded with single bonds.  Sometimes the chain has a place where hydrogen atoms are missing.  This is referred to as the point of unsaturation.  When one or more bonds between carbon atoms are a double  bond (C=C), that fatty acid is called an unsaturated fatty acid, as  it has one or more points of unsaturation. Any fatty acid that has  only one double bond is a monounsaturated fatty acid, an example  of which is olive oil (75 percent of its fat is monounsaturated).  Monounsaturated fats help regulate blood cholesterol levels,  thereby reducing the risk for heart disease and stroke. A  polyunsaturated fatty acid is a fatty acid with two or more double  bonds or two or more points of unsaturation. Soybean oil contains  high  amounts  of  polyunsaturated  fatty  acids.

            "monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats provide nutrition  that is essential for normal cell development and healthy skin.  Foods that have a high percentage of saturated fatty acids tend  to be solid at room temperature. Examples of these are fats found  in chocolate (stearic acid, an eighteen-carbon saturated fatty acid  is a primary component) and meat. Foods rich in unsaturated fatty  acids, such as olive oil (oleic acid, an eighteen-carbon unsaturated  fatty acid, is a major component) tend to be liquid at room  temperature. Flaxseed oil is rich in alpha-linolenic acid, which is  an unsaturated fatty acid and becomes a thin liquid at room  temperature.  Knowing the connection between chain length, degree of  saturation, and the state of the fatty acid (solid or liquid) is  important for making food choices. If you decide to limit or redirect  your intake of fat products, then choosing unsaturated fat is more  beneficial than choosing a saturated fat. This choice is easy enough  to make because unsaturated fats tend to be liquid at room  temperature (for example, olive oil) whereas saturated fats tend  to be solid at room temperature (for example, butter). Avocados  are rich in unsaturated fats. Most vegetable and fish oils contain  high quantities of polyunsaturated fats. Olive oil and canola oil are  also rich in monounsaturated fats. Conversely, tropical oils are an  exception to this rule in that they are liquid at room temperature  yet high in saturated fat. Palm oil (often used in food processing)  is highly saturated and has been proven to raise blood cholesterol.

When the hydrogen atoms are bonded  to the same side of the carbon chain, it is called a cis fatty acid.  Because the hydrogen atoms are on the same side, the carbon chain  has a bent structure. Naturally occurring fatty acids usually have a  cis configuration.  In a trans fatty acid, the hydrogen atoms are attached on opposite  sides of the carbon chain. Unlike cis fatty acids, most trans fatty  acids are not found naturally in foods, but are a result of a process  called hydrogenation. Hydrogenation is the process of adding  hydrogen to the carbon double bonds, thus making the fatty acid  saturated (or less unsaturated, in the case of partial hydrogenation).  This is how vegetable oils are converted into semisolid fats for use  in the manufacturing process.  According to the ongoing Harvard Nurses’ Health Study, trans  fatty acids have been associated with increased risk for coronary  heart disease because of the way they negatively impact blood  cholesterol levels.2  Figure 5.5 Structures of Saturated, Unsaturated, Cis and Trans  fatty Acids  2. Introduction to “Fats and Cholesterol: Out with the Bad,  In with the Good” The Nutrition Source.

Reports from the US  Department of Agriculture (USDA) indicate that these trans fats  comprise 15 to 20 percent of the total trans-fat intake in our diet.

            "Nonessential and Essential  Fatty Acids  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Fatty acids are vital for the normal operation of all body systems.  The circulatory system, respiratory system, integumentary system,  immune system, brain, and other organs require fatty acids for  proper function. The body is capable of synthesizing most of the  fatty acids it needs from food. These fatty acids are known as  nonessential fatty acids. However, there are some fatty acids that  the body cannot synthesize and these are called essential fatty  acids. It is important to note that nonessential fatty acids doesn’t  mean unimportant; the classification is based solely on the ability of  the body to synthesize the fatty acid.  Essential fatty acids must be obtained from food. They fall into  two categories—omega-3 and omega-6. The 3 and 6 refer to the  position of the first carbon double bond and the omega refers to  the methyl end of the chain. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids  are precursors to important compounds called eicosanoids.  Eicosanoids are powerful hormones that control many other  hormones and important body functions, such as the central  nervous system and the immune system. Eicosanoids derived from  omega-6 fatty acids are known to increase blood pressure, immune  response, and inflammation. In contrast, eicosanoids derived from  omega-3 fatty acids are known to have heart-healthy effects. Given  the contrasting effects of the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, a  proper dietary balance between the two must be achieved to ensure  optimal health benefits.

But  unlike triglycerides, phospholipids are diglycerides (two fatty-acid  molecules attached to the glycerol backbone) while their third fatty- acid chain has a phosphate group coupled with a nitrogen- containing group.

Phospholipids are what we call amphiphilic—the fatty-acid  sides are hydrophobic (dislike water) and the phosphate group is  hydrophilic (likes water).  In the body phospholipids bind together to form cell membranes.  The amphiphilic nature of phospholipids governs their function as  components of cell membranes.

Mayonnaise  demonstrates lecithin’s ability to blend vinegar and oil to create the  stable, spreadable condiment that so many enjoy. Food emulsifiers  play an important role in making the appearance of food appetizing.  Adding emulsifiers to sauces and creams not only enhances their  appearance but also increases their freshness.  Lecithin’s crucial role within the body is clear, because it is  present in every cell throughout the body; 28 percent of brain  matter is composed of lecithin and 66 percent of the fat in the liver  is lecithin.

Like  carbohydrates and protein, lipids are broken into small components  for absorption. Since most of our digestive enzymes are water- based, how does the body break down fat and make it available for  the various functions it must perform in the human body?  From the Mouth to the Stomach  The first step in the digestion of triglycerides and phospholipids  begins in the mouth as lipids encounter saliva. Next, the physical  action of chewing coupled with the action of emulsifiers enables the  digestive enzymes to do their tasks. The enzyme lingual lipase, along  with a small amount of phospholipid as an emulsifier, initiates the  process of digestion. These actions cause the fats to become more  accessible to the digestive enzymes. As a result, the fats become tiny  droplets and separate from the watery components.

Inside mucuosal cell, fatty acids and  monoglycerides reassembled into triglycerides and  incorporated into lipids transport particles called  chylomicrons, which enter the lymph vessel.  In the stomach, gastric lipase starts to break down triglycerides  into diglycerides and fatty acids. Within two to four hours after  eating a meal, roughly 30 percent of the triglycerides are converted  to diglycerides and fatty acids. The stomach’s churning and  contractions help to disperse the fat molecules, while the  diglycerides derived in this process act as further emulsifiers.  However, even amid all of this activity, very little fat digestion occurs  in the stomach.  Going to the Bloodstream  As stomach contents enter the small intestine, the digestive system  sets out to manage a small hurdle, namely, to combine the separated  fats with its own watery fluids.

It attracts and holds onto  fat while it is simultaneously attracted to and held on to by water.  Emulsification increases the surface area of lipids over a thousand- fold, making them more accessible to the digestive enzymes.  Once the stomach contents have been emulsified, fat-breaking  enzymes work on the triglycerides and diglycerides to sever fatty  acids from their glycerol foundations. As pancreatic lipase enters  the small intestine, it breaks down the fats into free fatty acids  and monoglycerides. Yet again, another hurdle presents itself. How  will the fats pass through the watery layer of mucus that coats  the absorptive lining of the digestive tract? As before, the answer  is bile. Bile salts envelop the fatty acids and monoglycerides to  form micelles. Micelles have a fatty acid core with a water-soluble  exterior. This allows efficient transportation to the intestinal  microvillus.  Here,  the  fat  components  are  released  and  disseminated into the cells of the digestive tract lining.

Inside the intestinal cells, the  monoglycerides and fatty acids reassemble themselves into  triglycerides. Triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids form  lipoproteins when joined with a protein carrier. Lipoproteins have  an inner core that is primarily made up of triglycerides and  cholesterol esters (a cholesterol ester is a cholesterol linked to a  fatty acid). The outer envelope is made of phospholipids  interspersed with proteins and cholesterol. Together they form a  chylomicron, which is a large lipoprotein that now enters the  lymphatic system and will soon be released into the bloodstream  via the jugular vein in the neck. Chylomicrons transport food fats  perfectly through the body’s water-based environment to specific  destinations such as the liver and other body tissues.  Cholesterols  are  poorly  absorbed  when  compared  to  phospholipids and triglycerides. Cholesterol absorption is aided by  an increase in dietary fat components and is hindered by high fiber  content. This is the reason that a high intake of fiber is  322  |  Digestion and Absorption of Lipids\n",

Foods high in fiber  such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and oats can bind bile salts and  cholesterol, preventing their absorption and carrying them out of  the colon.  If fats are not absorbed properly as is seen in some medical  conditions, a person’s stool will contain high amounts of fat. If fat  malabsorption persists the condition is known as steatorrhea.  Steatorrhea can result from diseases that affect absorption, such as  Crohn’s disease and cystic fibrosis.

            "Carbohydrates chapter. The body transforms carbohydrates into  glycogen that is in turn stored in the muscles for energy. When  the muscles reach their capacity for glycogen storage, the excess  is returned to the liver, where it is converted into triglycerides and  then stored as fat.  In a similar manner, much of the triglycerides the body receives  from food is transported to fat storehouses within the body if not  used for producing energy. The chylomicrons are responsible for  shuttling the triglycerides to various locations such as the muscles,  breasts, external layers under the skin, and internal fat layers of the  abdomen, thighs, and buttocks where they are stored by the body  in adipose tissue for future use. How is this accomplished? Recall  that chylomicrons are large lipoproteins that contain a triglyceride  and fatty-acid core. Capillary walls contain an enzyme called  lipoprotein-lipase  that  dismantles  the  triglycerides  in  the  lipoproteins into fatty acids and glycerol, thus enabling these to  enter into the adipose cells. Once inside the adipose cells, the fatty  acids and glycerol are reassembled into triglycerides and stored for  later use. Muscle cells may also take up the fatty acids and use them  for muscular work and generating energy. When a person’s energy  requirements exceed the amount of available fuel presented from a  recent meal or extended physical activity has exhausted glycogen  energy reserves, fat reserves are retrieved for energy utilization.  As the body calls for additional energy, the adipose tissue  responds by dismantling its triglycerides and dispensing glycerol  and fatty acids directly into the blood. Upon receipt of these  substances the energy-hungry cells break them down further into  tiny fragments. These fragments go through a series of chemical  reactions that yield energy, carbon dioxide, and water.  Figure 5.14 Storing and Using Fat  324  |  Digestion and Absorption of Lipids\n",

What should you know about these lipoproteins?  Major Lipoproteins  Recall that chylomicrons are transporters of fats throughout the  watery environment within the body. After about ten hours of  circulating throughout the body, chylomicrons gradually release  their triglycerides until all that is left of their composition is  Digestion and Absorption of Lipids  |  325\n",
            "cholesterol-rich remnants. These remnants are used as raw  materials by the liver to formulate specific lipoproteins. Following is  a list of the various lipoproteins and their functions:  • VLDLs. Very low-density lipoproteins are made in the liver  from remnants of chylomicrons and transport triglycerides  from the liver to various tissues in the body. As the VLDLs  travel through the circulatory system, the lipoprotein lipase  strips the VLDL of triglycerides. As triglyceride removal  persists, the VLDLs become intermediate-density lipoproteins.  • IDLs. Intermediate-density lipoproteins transport a variety of  fats and cholesterol in the bloodstream and are a little under  half triglyceride in composition. While travelling in the  bloodstream, cholesterol is gained from other lipoproteins  while circulating enzymes strip its phospholipid component.  When IDLs return to the liver, they are transformed into low- density lipoprotein.  • LDLs. As low-density lipoproteins are commonly known as the  “bad cholesterol” it is imperative that we understand their  function in the body so as to make healthy dietary and lifestyle  choices. LDLs carry cholesterol and other lipids from the liver  to tissue throughout the body. LDLs are comprised of very  small amounts of triglycerides, and house over 50 percent  cholesterol and cholesterol esters. How does the body receive  the lipids contained therein? As the LDLs deliver cholesterol  and other lipids to the cells, each cell’s surface has receptor  systems specifically designed to bind with LDLs. Circulating  LDLs in the bloodstream bind to these LDL receptors and are  consumed. Once inside the cell, the LDL is taken apart and its  cholesterol is released. In liver cells these receptor systems aid  in controlling blood cholesterol levels as they bind the LDLs. A  deficiency of these LDL binding mechanisms will leave a high  quantity of cholesterol traveling in the bloodstream, which can  lead to heart disease or atherosclerosis. Diets rich in saturated  fats will prohibit the LDL receptors which, are critical for  326  |  Digestion and Absorption of Lipids\n",

High-density lipoproteins are responsible for carrying  cholesterol out of the bloodstream and into the liver, where it  is either reused or removed from the body with bile. HDLs  have a very large protein composition coupled with low  cholesterol content (20 to 30 percent) compared to the other  lipoproteins. Hence, these high-density lipoproteins are  commonly called “good cholesterol.”  Figure 5.15 Lipoprotein Classes  The classification of the major types of lipoproteins are based on  their densities.

In contrast, a low value  of HDL is a telltale sign that a person is living with major risks  for disease. Values of less than 40 mg/dL for men and 50 mg/ dL for women mark a risk factor for developing heart disease. In  short, elevated LDL blood lipid profiles indicate an increased risk  of heart attack, while elevated HDL blood lipid profiles indicate  a reduced risk.The University of Maryland Medical Center reports  that omega-3 fatty acids promote lower total cholesterol and lower  triglycerides in people with high cholesterol.1  It is suggested that people consume omega-3 fatty acids such as  alpha-linolenic acid in their diets regularly. Polyunsaturated fatty  acids are especially beneficial to consume because they both lower  LDL and elevate HDL, thus contributing to healthy blood cholesterol  levels. The study also reveals that saturated and trans fatty acids  serve as catalysts for the increase of LDL cholesterol.

Remember that  saturated fats found in some meat, whole-fat dairy products, and  tropical oils elevate your total cholesterol. Trans fats, such as the  ones often found in margarines, processed cookies, pastries,  crackers, fried foods, and snack foods also elevate your cholesterol  levels. Read and select from the following suggestions as you plan  ahead:  1. Soluble fiber reduces cholesterol absorption in the  bloodstream. Try eating more oatmeal, oat bran, kidney beans,  apples, pears, citrus fruits, barley, and prunes.  2. Fatty fish are heart-healthy due to high levels of omega-3 fatty  acids that reduce inflammation and lower cholesterol levels.  Consume mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, tuna, salmon,  and halibut. Grilling or baking is the best to avoid unhealthy  trans fats that could be added from frying oil.  3. Walnuts, almonds, peanuts, hazelnuts, pecans, some pine nuts,  and pistachios all contain high levels of unsaturated fatty acids  that aid in lowering LDL. Make sure the nuts are raw and  unsalted. Avoid sugary or salty nuts. One ounce each day is a  good amount.  4. Olive oil contains a strong mix of antioxidants and  monounsaturated fat, and may lower LDL while leaving HDL  intact. Two tablespoons per day in place of less healthy  saturated fats may contribute to these heart-healthy effects  without adding extra calories.

The current AMDR for child and adolescent fat consumption (for  children over four) are as follows:  • For children between ages four and eighteen years, between 25  and 35 percent of caloric intake should be from fat.  • For all age groups, most fats should come from  polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats such as fish, nuts,  and vegetable oils.

Common sources are nuts (almonds, cashews, pecans, peanuts,  and walnuts) and nut products, avocados, olive oil, sesame oil,  high oleic safflower oil, sunflower oil, and canola oil.  • Polyunsaturated fat. This type of fat is found mainly in plant- based foods, oils, and fish. Common sources are nuts (walnuts,  hazel nuts, pecans, almonds, and peanuts), soybean oil, corn  oil, safflower oil, flaxseed oil, canola oil, and fish (trout,  herring, and salmon).  • Saturated fat.

Eggs, poultry, most  vegetable oils, wheat germ oil, whole grains, baked goods, and  cereals contain these fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids are  present abundantly in nuts and seeds such as flaxseeds,  sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, and watermelon seeds.  Omega-3 and Omega-6 Fatty Acids  Recall that the body requires fatty acids and is adept at synthesizing  the majority of these from fat, protein, and carbohydrate. However,  when we say essential fatty acid we are referring to the two fatty  acids that the body cannot create on its own, namely, linolenic acid  and linoleic acid.  • Omega-3 Fatty Acids. At the helm of the omega-3 fatty acid  family is linolenic acid. From this fatty acid, the body can make  eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).  Linolenic acid is found in nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes,  and vegetable oil such as soybean, canola, and flaxseed. EPA  and DHA are found abundantly in fatty fish.  • Omega-6 Fatty Acids. At the helm of the omega-6 fatty acid  family is linoleic acid. Like linolenic acid, the body uses linoleic  acid to make other important substances such as arachidonic  acid (ARA) that is used to make eicosanoids. Recall that  eicosanoids perform critical roles in the body as they affect a  broad spectrum of functions. The word eicosanoid originates  from the Greek word eicosa, meaning twenty, because this  hormone is derived from ARA that is twenty carbon atoms in  length. Eicosanoids affect the synthesis of all other body  hormones and control all body systems, such as the central  nervous system and the immune system. Among the many  336  |  Tools for Change\n",

Without these hormones the body  would not be able to heal wounds, fight infections, or fight off  illness each time a foreign germ presented itself. Eicosanoids  work together with the body’s immune and inflammatory  processes to play a major role in several important body  functions, such as circulation, respiration, and muscle  movement.  Attain the Omega-3 and Omega-6 Balance  As our food choices evolve, the sources of omega-6 fatty acids  in our diets are increasing at a much faster rate than sources of  omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s are plentiful in diets of non- processed foods where grazing animals and foraging chickens roam  free, eating grass, clover, alfalfa, and grass-dwelling insects. In  contrast, today’s western diets are bombarded with sources of  omega-6. For example, we have oils derived from seeds and nuts  and from the meat of animals that are fed grain. Vegetable oils used  in fast-food preparations, most snack-foods, cookies, crackers, and  sweet treats are also loaded with omega-6 fatty acids. Also, our  bodies synthesize eicosanoids from omega-6 fatty acids and these  tend to increase inflammation, blood clotting, and cell proliferation,  while the hormones synthesized from omega-3 fatty acids have just  the opposite effect.  While omega-6 fatty acids are essential, they can be harmful  when they are out of balance with omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-6  fats are required only in small quantities. Researchers believe that  when omega-6 fats are out of balance with omega-3 fats in the  diet they diminish the effects of omega-3 fats and their benefits.

            "Lipids and the Food Industry  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  What is the first thing that comes to mind when you read  ingredients such as “partially hydrogenated oil” and “hydrogenated  oil” on a food label? Do you think of heart disease, heart health, or  atherosclerosis? Most people probably do not. As we uncover what  hydrogenation is and why manufacturers use it, you will be better  equipped to adhere to healthier dietary choices and promote your  heart health.  Hydrogenation: The Good Gone Bad?  Food manufacturers are aware that fatty acids are susceptible to  attack by oxygen molecules because their points of unsaturation  render them vulnerable in this regard. When oxygen molecules  attack these points of unsaturation the modified fatty acid becomes  oxidized. The oxidation of fatty acids makes the oil rancid and gives  the food prepared with it an unappetizing taste. Because oils can  undergo oxidation when stored in open containers, they must be  stored in airtight containers and possibly be refrigerated to  minimize damage from oxidation. Hydrogenation poses a solution  that food manufacturers prefer.  When lipids are subjected to hydrogenation, the molecular  structure of the fat is altered. Hydrogenation is the process of  adding hydrogen to unsaturated fatty-acid chains, so that the  hydrogen atoms are connected to the points of saturation and  results in a more saturated fatty acid. Liquid oils that once  contained more unsaturated fatty acids become semisolid or solid  (upon complete hydrogenation) and behave like saturated fats. Oils  340  |  Lipids and the Food Industry\n",
            "initially contain polyunsaturated fatty acids. When the process of  hydrogenation is not complete, for example, not all carbon double  bonds have been saturated the end result is a partially hydrogenated  oil. The resulting oil is not fully solid. Total hydrogenation makes  the oil very hard and virtually unusable. Some newer products are  now using fully hydrogenated oil combined with nonhydrogenated  vegetable oils to create a usable fat.  Manufacturers favor hydrogenation as a way to prevent oxidation  of oils and ensure longer shelf life. Partially hydrogenated vegetable  oils are used in the fast food and processed food industries because  they impart the desired texture and crispness to baked and fried  foods. Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are more resistant to  breakdown from extremely hot cooking temperatures. Because  hydrogenated oils have a high smoking point they are very well  suited for frying. In addition, processed vegetable oils are cheaper  than fats obtained from animal sources, making them a popular  choice for the food industry.  Trans fatty acids occur in small amounts in nature, mostly in  dairy products. However, the trans fats that are used by the food  industry are produced from the hydrogenation process. Trans fats  are a result of the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids,  which cause them to have a trans configuration, rather than the  naturally occurring cis configuration.  Health Implications of Trans Fats  No trans fats! Zero trans fats! We see these advertisements on a  regular basis. So widespread is the concern over the issue that  restaurants, food manufacturers, and even fast-food establishments  proudly tout either the absence or the reduction of these fats within  their products. Amid the growing awareness that trans fats may not  be good for you, let’s get right to the heart of the matter. Why are  trans fats so bad?  Lipids and the Food Industry  |  341\n",
            "Processing naturally occurring fats to modify their texture from  liquid to semisolid and solid forms results in the development of  trans fats, which have been linked to an increased risk for heart  disease. Trans fats are used in many processed foods such as  cookies, cakes, chips, doughnuts, and snack foods to give them their  crispy texture and increased shelf life. However, because trans fats  can behave like saturated fats, the body processes them as if they  were saturated fats. Consuming large amounts of trans fats has been  associated with tissue inflammation throughout the body, insulin  resistance in some people, weight gain, and digestive troubles. In  addition, the hydrogenation process robs the person of the benefits  of consuming the original oil because hydrogenation destroys  omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. The AHA states that, like  saturated fats, trans fats raise LDL “bad cholesterol,” but unlike  saturated fats, trans fats lower HDL “good cholesterol.” The AHA  advises limiting trans-fat consumption to less than 1 percent.  How can you benefit from this information? When selecting your  foods, steer clear of anything that says “hydrogenated,” “fractionally  hydrogenated,” or “partially hydrogenated,” and read food labels in  the following categories carefully:  • cookies, crackers, cakes, muffins, pie crusts, pizza dough, and  breads  • stick margarines and vegetable shortening  • premixed cake mixes, pancake mixes, and drink mixes  • fried foods and hard taco shells  • snack foods (such as chips), candy, and frozen dinners  Choose brands that don’t use trans fats and that are low in saturated  fats.  342  |  Lipids and the Food Industry\n",
            "Dietary-Fat Substitutes  In response to the rising awareness and concern over the  consumption of trans fat, various fat replacers have been developed.  Fat substitutes aim to mimic the richness, taste, and smooth feel  of fat without the same caloric content as fat. The carbohydrate- based replacers tend to bind water and thus dilute calories. Fat  substitutes can also be made from proteins (for example, egg whites  and milk whey). However, these are not very stable and are affected  by changes in temperature, hence their usefulness is somewhat  limited.  Tools for Change  One classic cinnamon roll can have 5 grams of trans fat, which is  quite high for a single snack. Many packaged foods often have their  nutrient contents listed for a very small serving size—much smaller  than what people normally consume—which can easily lead you to  eat many “servings.” Labeling laws allow foods containing trans fat  to be labeled “trans-fat free” if there are fewer than 0.5 grams per  serving. This makes it possible to eat too much trans fat when you  think you’re not eating any at all because it is labeled trans-fat free.  Always review the label for trans fat per serving. Check the  ingredient list, especially the first three to four ingredients, for  telltale signs of hydrogenated fat such as partially or fractionated  hydrogenated oil. The higher up the words “partially hydrogenated  oil” are on the list of ingredients, the more trans fat the product  contains.  Measure out one serving and eat one serving only.

How saturated is the fat in your diet? Is it really necessary to  eat saturated fat when the body makes all the saturated fat that it  needs? Saturated fats should fall into the “bad” category—the body  does not demand this kind of fat and it is proven to be a forerunner  of cardiovascular disease. In the United States and other developed  countries, populations acquire their saturated fat content mostly  from meat, seafood, poultry (with skin consumed), and whole-milk  dairy products (cheese, milk, and ice cream). Some plant foods are  also high in saturated fats, including coconut oil, palm oil, and palm  kernel oil.  Food Cholesterol’s Effect on Blood  Cholesterol  Dietary cholesterol does have a small impact on overall blood  cholesterol levels, but not as much as some people may think. The  average American female consumes 237 milligrams of dietary  cholesterol per day and for males the figure is slightly higher—about  358 milligrams. Most people display little response to normal  dietary cholesterol intake as the body responds by halting its own  synthesis of the substance in favor of using the cholesterol obtained  1. Fats and Cholesterol: Out with the Bad, In with the  Good.

The 2015-2020 US Dietary Guidelines  suggest limiting saturated fats, thereby indirectly limiting dietary  cholesterol since foods that are high in cholesterol tend to be high  in saturated fats also.  A Prelude to Disease  If left unchecked, improper dietary fat consumption can lead down  a path to severe health problems. An increased level of lipids,  triglycerides, and cholesterol in the blood is called hyperlipidemia.  Hyperlipidemia is inclusive of several conditions but more  commonly refers to high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. When  blood lipid levels are high, any number of adverse health problems  may ensue. Consider the following:  • Cardiovascular disease. According to the AHA, cardiovascular  disease encompasses a variety of problems, many of which are  related to the process of atherosclerosis. Over time the  arteries thicken and harden with plaque buildup, causing  restricted or at times low or no blood flow to selected areas of  the body.  • Heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to a  section of the heart is cut off due to a blood clot. Many have  survived heart attacks and go on to return to their lives and  enjoy many more years of life on this earth. However, dietary  and lifestyle changes must be implemented to prevent further  attacks.  • Ischemic stroke. The most common type of stroke in the  United States, ischemic stroke, occurs when a blood vessel in  the brain or leading to the brain becomes blocked, again  usually from a blood clot. If part of the brain suffers lack of  blood flow and/or oxygen for three minutes or longer, brain  Lipids and Disease  |  347\n",
            "cells will start to die.  • Congestive heart failure. Sometimes referred to as heart  failure, this condition indicates that the heart is not pumping  blood as well as it should. The heart is still working but it is not  meeting the body’s demand for blood and oxygen. If left  unchecked, it can progress to further levels of malfunction.  • Arrhythmia. This is an abnormal rhythm of the heart. The heart  may beat above one hundred beats per minute (known as  tachycardia) or below sixty beats per minute (known as  bradycardia), or the beats are not regular. The heart may not  be able to pump enough volume of blood to meet the body’s  needs.  • Heart valve problems. Stenosis is a condition wherein the heart  valves become compromised in their ability to open wide  enough to allow proper blood flow. When the heart valves do  not close tightly and blood begins to leak between chambers,  this is called regurgitation. When valves bulge or prolapse back  into the upper chamber, this condition is called mitral valve  prolapse.  • Obesity. Obesity is defined as the excessive accumulation of  body fat. According to US Surgeon General Richard Carmona,  obesity is the fastest growing cause of death in America.

Limiting the intake of saturated fats and trans fats,  increasing physical activity, and eating fewer calories are all  equally important in this fight against obesity.  What You Can Do  Remember that saturated fats are found in large amounts in foods  of animal origin. They should be limited within the diet.  Polyunsaturated fats are generally obtained from non-animal  sources. While they are beneficial for lowering bad cholesterol they  also lower good cholesterol. They are better for you than saturated  fats but are not to be consumed in excess. Monounsaturated fats  are of plant origin and are found in most nuts, seeds, seed oils, olive  oil, canola oil, and legumes. Monounsaturated fats are excellent  because they not only lower bad cholesterol, but also they elevate  the good cholesterol. Replace current dietary fats with an increased  intake of monounsaturated fats.  Choose whole-grain and high-fiber foods. Reduced risk for  cardiovascular disease has been associated with diets that are high  in whole grains and fiber. Fiber also slows down cholesterol  absorption. The AHA recommends that at least half of daily grain  intake should originate from whole grains. The Adequate Intake  value for fiber is 14 grams per 1,000 kilocalories. These amounts  are based upon the amount of fiber that has been shown to reduce  cardiovascular risk.  Do not be sedentary. Get more exercise on a regular basis.  Increasing your energy expenditure by just twenty minutes of  physical activity at least three times per week will improve your  overall health. Physical exercise can help you manage or prevent  high blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels. Regular activity  raises HDL while at the same time decreases triglycerides and  plaque buildup in the arteries. Calories are burned consistently,  Lipids and Disease  |  349\n",

Create a shopping list and divide your  list into columns for “Best,” “Better,” “Good,” “Least Desirable,” and  “Infrequent Foods.” As you refine your sense of dietary fat, here are  key points to bear in mind:  • Shopping for groceries. Don’t be bombarded with gratuitous  grams of saturated fats and empty grams of trans fats. Read  and decipher food labels carefully so that you know exactly  what types of fat a food item contains and how much fat it will  contribute to your overall fat intake. For snacks and daily  eating, gravitate toward foods that are lowest in or absent of  harmful trans fats. Restrict other foods to occasional usage  based upon their fat content. For example, if selecting  prepared foods, choose the ones without high-fat sauces in  favor of adding your own flavorings. If selecting precooked  meats, avoid those that are fried, coated, or prepared in high- fat sauces. A popular and healthy precooked meat food choice  is the rotisserie chicken that most supermarkets carry. When  selecting meats be aware of the need to compare different  cuts—notice their fat content, color, and marbling. Higher-fat  meats tend to have whiter fat marbled throughout.

            "lean cuts and white meat as these are lower in saturated fat.  Always choose plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, and  seeds, as their phytosterols are a good competitor for  cholesterol. Keep a collection of nuts in your freezer that can  be added to your salads, stir-fry, one-dish foods, soups,  desserts, and yogurts.  • Appearance. Saturated and trans fats are not good for you and  must be placed in your “Least Desirable” column because they  increase cholesterol levels and put you at risk for heart  disease. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are better  choices to replace these undesirable fats. The key in  identifying the “Best” or “Better” fats from the “Least Desirable”  fats while you shop is based upon appearance. When choosing  fats remember that saturated fats and trans fats are solid at  room temperature; think of butter. Monounsaturated and  polyunsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature; think of  vegetable oil.  • Try to eliminate as much trans fat as possible from your food  selections. Avoid commercially baked goods and fast foods.  Make these your “Infrequent Foods.”  • Choose unsaturated fats. Fatty fish, walnuts, flaxseeds,  flaxseed oil, and canola oil all have good health benefits and  should be on the “Best,” “Better,” and “Good” fat lists. They each  provide essential omega-3 fatty acids necessary for overall  body health. To derive the most benefit from including these  foods, do not add them to an existing diet full of fat. Use these  to replace the “Least Desirable” fats that are being removed  from the diet.  • Limit saturated fat intake. Reduce red meat consumption,  processed meats, and whole-fat dairy products. To reduce full- fat dairy items try their low-fat or nonfat counterparts such as  mozzarella cheese.  • Low fat does not equal healthy. Remember, a fat-free label  does not provide you with a license to consume all the calories  you desire. There will be consequences to your weight and  352  |  A Personal Choice about Lipids\n",

Choose and consume wisely.  • A “better-fat” diet will successfully support weight loss.  While cutting “Least Desirable” fat calories are vital to weight  loss, remember that “Better” fats are filling and just a handful  of nuts can curb an appetite to prevent overeating.  • Consume omega-3 fats each day. For optimal health and  disease prevention include a moderate serving of fish, walnuts,  ground flaxseeds, flaxseed oil, or soybean oil in your diet every  day.  • How much saturated fat is too much? Your goal is to keep  your intake of saturated fat to no more than 10 percent of your  total dietary calories on a daily basis. Thus, it is important to  learn to reduce the intake of foods high in saturated fat. High- fat foods can be consumed but they must fall within the overall  goal for a person’s fat allowance for the day.  • Home cooking. Limit the use of saturated fats in home  preparation of meals. Instead of butter try spreads made from  unsaturated oils such as canola or olive oils and the use of  cooking sprays. Couple this with the use of herbs and spices to  add flavor. Avoid using high-fat meat gravies, cheese, and  cream sauces. Limit adding extras to foods such as butter on a  baked potato. Use nonfat sour cream instead. Grill, bake, stir- fry, roast, or bake your foods. Never fry in solid fats such as  butter or shortening. Marinate foods to be grilled in fruit juices  and herbs. Instead of relying upon commercial salad dressings,  learn to make your own top-quality dressing from cold- pressed olive oil, flaxseed oil, or sesame oil.  • Make sure the fat is flavorful. Adding flavor to food is what  makes the eating experience enjoyable. Why not choose  unsaturated fats and oils that have strong flavors? In this way  you will add good flavor to your meals but use less fat in the  process. Some examples are sesame oil, peanut oil, and peanut  A Personal Choice about Lipids  |  353\n",

Therefore, protein is an  essential nutrient that must be consumed in the diet. Many Pacific  Island societies such as the Native Hawaiians accompanied their  starch meals with some type of meat or seafood. In Hawai‘i, a typical  meal consisted of taro or poi accompanied with fish. Fish is known  to be a complete protein source which means that all nine essential  amino acids are present in the recommended amounts needed.  Native Hawaiians ate their fish raw, cooked, salted or dried. If the  fish was to be eaten raw, it was prepared by mashing the flesh with  the fingers (lomi) to soften the meat and allow the salt to penetrate  the flesh deeper. If the fish was not soft enough to lomi, it was cut  into chunks or slices or left whole. Today, the most popular and  contemporary prepared way of eating fish is known as poke.  Poke,  which means “cut up pieces” in Hawaiian, is chopped up chunks  of fish that can be seasoned in a variety of different ways.  Some  common ways of seasoning include salt, shoyu (soy sauce), limu  (seaweed), garlic, and onions. Any type of fish can be used to make  poke but ahi (tuna) fish is typically the most desirable option.1  Your protein-rich muscles allow for body strength and  movement, which enable you to enjoy many activities.  1. Fish Preparation/Eating.

            "Defining Protein  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Protein makes up approximately 20 percent of the human body and  is present in every single cell. The word protein is a Greek word,  meaning “of utmost importance.” Proteins are called the workhorses  of life as they provide the body with structure and perform a vast  array of functions. You can stand, walk, run, skate, swim, and more  because of your protein-rich muscles. Protein is necessary for  proper immune system function, digestion, and hair and nail  growth, and is involved in numerous other body functions. In fact,  it is estimated that more than one hundred thousand different  proteins exist within the human body. In this chapter you will learn  about the components of protein, the important roles that protein  serves within the body, how the body uses protein, the risks and  consequences associated with too much or too little protein, and  where to find healthy sources of it in your diet.  What Is Protein?  Proteins, simply put, are macromolecules composed of amino acids.  Amino acids are commonly called protein’s building blocks. Proteins  are crucial for the nourishment, renewal, and continuance of life.  Proteins contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen just  as carbohydrates and lipids do, but proteins are the only  macronutrient that contains nitrogen. In each amino acid the  elements are arranged into a specific conformation around a carbon  center. Each amino acid consists of a central carbon atom  connected to a side chain, a hydrogen, a nitrogen-containing amino  group, and a carboxylic acid group—hence the name “amino acid.”  Defining Protein  |  363\n",
            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  Amino acids differ from each other by which specific side chain is  bonded to the carbon center.  Figure 6.1 Amino Acid Structure  Amino acids contain four elements. The arrangement of elements  around the carbon center is the same for all amino acids. Only the  side chain (R) differs.  It’s All in the Side Chain  The side chain of an amino acid, sometimes called the “R” group, can  be as simple as one hydrogen bonded to the carbon center, or as  complex as a six-carbon ring bonded to the carbon center. Although  each side chain of the twenty amino acids is unique, there are some  chemical likenesses among them. Therefore, they can be classified  into four different groups. These are nonpolar, polar, acidic, and  basic.  Figure 6.2 The Different Groups of Amino Acids  364  |  Defining Protein\n",
            "Amino acids  are classified  into four  groups.  These are  nonpolar,  polar, acidic,  and basic.  Essential and Nonessential Amino Acids  Amino acids are further classified based on nutritional aspects.  Recall that there are twenty different amino acids, and we require all  of them to make the many different proteins found throughout the  body. Eleven of these are called nonessential amino acids because  the body can synthesize them. However, nine of the amino acids  are called essential amino acids because we cannot synthesize them  either at all or in sufficient amounts. These must be obtained from  the diet. Sometimes during infancy, growth, and in diseased states  the body cannot synthesize enough of some of the nonessential  amino acids and more of them are required in the diet. These types  of amino acids are called conditionally essential amino acids. The  nutritional value of a protein is dependent on what amino acids it  contains and in what quantities.

Different proteins are produced  because there are twenty types of naturally occurring amino acids  that are combined in unique sequences to form polypeptides. These  polypeptide chains then fold into a three-dimensional shape to form  a protein (see Figure 6.3 “Formation of Polypeptides”). Additionally,  proteins come in many different sizes. The hormone insulin, which  regulates blood glucose, is composed of only fifty-one amino acids;  whereas collagen, a protein that acts like glue between cells,  consists of more than one thousand amino acids. Titin is the largest  known protein. It accounts for the elasticity of muscles, and consists  of more than twenty-five thousand amino acids! The abundant  variations of proteins are due to the unending number of amino acid  sequences that can be formed. To compare how so many different  proteins can be designed from only twenty amino acids, think about  366  |  Defining Protein\n",

As a result, there is a vast array of music and songs all  composed of specific sequences from these basic musical notes.  Similarly, the twenty amino acids can be linked together in an  extraordinary number of sequences, much more than are possible  for the seven musical notes to create songs. As a result, there are  enormous variations and potential amino acid sequences that can  be created. For example, if an amino acid sequence for a protein  is 104 amino acids long the possible combinations of amino acid  sequences is equal to 20104, which is 2 followed by 135 zeros!

            "reactions that can be summarized into three basic steps:  transcription, translation, and protein folding. The first step in  constructing a protein is the transcription (copying) of the genetic  information in double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into  the single-stranded, messenger macromolecule ribonucleic acid  (RNA). RNA is chemically similar to DNA, but has two differences;  one is that its backbone uses the sugar ribose and not deoxyribose;  and two, it contains the nucleotide base uracil, and not thymidine.  The RNA that is transcribed from a given piece of DNA contains the  same information as that DNA, but it is now in a form that can be  read by the cellular protein manufacturer known as the ribosome.  Next, the RNA instructs the cells to gather all the necessary amino  acids and add them to the growing protein chain in a very specific  order. This process is referred to as translation. The decoding of  genetic information to synthesize a protein is the central foundation  of modern biology.  Figure 6.4 Steps for Building a Protein  368  |  Defining Protein\n",
            "Building a protein involves three steps: transcription, translation,  Defining Protein  |  369\n",
            "and folding. During translation each amino acid is connected to the  next amino acid by a special chemical bond called a peptide bond.  The peptide bond forms between the carboxylic acid group of one  amino acid and the amino group of another, releasing a molecule  of water. The third step in protein production involves folding it  into its correct shape. Specific amino acid sequences contain all  the information necessary to spontaneously fold into a particular  shape. A change in the amino acid sequence will cause a change in  protein shape. Each protein in the human body differs in its amino  acid sequence and consequently, its shape. The newly synthesized  protein is structured to perform a particular function in a cell.  A protein made with an incorrectly placed amino acid may not  function properly and this can sometimes cause disease.  Protein Organization  Protein’s structure enables it to perform a variety of functions.  Proteins are similar to carbohydrates and lipids in that they are  polymers of simple repeating units; however, proteins are much  more structurally complex. In contrast to carbohydrates, which  have identical repeating units, proteins are made up of amino acids  that are different from one another. Furthermore, a protein is  organized into four different structural levels.  Primary: The first level is the one-dimensional sequence of amino  acids that are held together by peptide bonds. Carbohydrates and  lipids also are one-dimensional sequences of their respective  monomers, which may be branched, coiled, fibrous, or globular, but  their conformation is much more random and is not organized by  their sequence of monomers.  Secondary: The second level of protein structure is dependent  on the chemical interactions between amino acids, which cause the  protein to fold into a specific shape, such as a helix (like a coiled  spring) or sheet.  370  |  Defining Protein\n",
            "Tertiary: The third level of protein structure is three- dimensional. As the different side chains of amino acids chemically  interact, they either repel or attract each other, resulting in the  folded structure. Thus, the specific sequence of amino acids in a  protein directs the protein to fold into a specific, organized shape.  Quaternary:  The fourth level of structure is achieved when  protein fragments called peptides combine to make one larger  functional protein. The protein hemoglobin is an example of a  protein that has quaternary structure. It is composed of four  peptides that bond together to form a functional oxygen carrier.  A protein’s structure also influences its nutritional quality. Large  fibrous protein structures are more difficult to digest than smaller  proteins and some, such as keratin, are indigestible. Because  digestion of some fibrous proteins is incomplete, not all of the  amino acids are absorbed and available for the body to utilize,  thereby decreasing their nutritional value.

Protein provides food with structure and texture  and enables water retention. For example, proteins foam when  agitated. (Picture whisking egg whites to make angel food cake. The  foam bubbles are what give the angel food cake its airy texture.)  Yogurt is another good example of proteins providing texture. Milk  proteins called caseins coagulate, increasing yogurt’s thickness.  Cooked proteins add some color and flavor to foods as the amino  group binds with carbohydrates and produces a brown pigment and  aroma. Eggs are between 10 and 15 percent protein by weight. Most  cake recipes use eggs because the egg proteins help bind all the  other ingredients together into a uniform cake batter. The proteins  aggregate into a network during mixing and baking that gives cake  structure.  374  |  The Role of Proteins in Foods: Cooking and Denaturation\n",
            "Image by  Annie Spratt  on  unspash.com  / CC0  Protein Denaturation: Unraveling the Fold  When a cake is baked, the proteins are denatured. Denaturation  refers to the physical changes that take place in a protein exposed  to abnormal conditions in the environment. Heat, acid, high salt  concentrations, alcohol, and mechanical agitation can cause  proteins to denature. When a protein denatures, its complicated  folded structure unravels, and it becomes just a long strand of  amino acids again. Weak chemical forces that hold tertiary and  secondary protein structures together are broken when a protein  is exposed to unnatural conditions. Because proteins’ function is  dependent on their shape, denatured proteins are no longer  functional. During cooking the applied heat causes proteins to  vibrate. This destroys the weak bonds holding proteins in their  complex shape (though this does not happen to the stronger  peptide bonds). The unraveled protein strands then stick together,  forming an aggregate (or network).  The Role of Proteins in Foods: Cooking and Denaturation  |  375\n",

When you  eat food the body’s digestive system breaks down the protein into  the individual amino acids, which are absorbed and used by cells to  build other proteins and a few other macromolecules, such as DNA.  We previously discussed the general process of food digestion,  let’s  follow the specific path that proteins take down the gastrointestinal  tract and into the circulatory system (Figure 6.7 “Digestion and  Absorption of Protein”). Eggs are a good dietary source of protein  and will be used as our example to describe the path of proteins  in the processes of digestion and absorption. One egg, whether  raw, hard-boiled, scrambled, or fried, supplies about six grams of  protein.  Figure 6.7 Digestion and Absorption of Protein  378  |  Protein Digestion and Absorption\n",
            "From the Mouth to the Stomach  Unless you are eating it raw, the first step in egg digestion (or  any other protein food) involves chewing. The teeth begin the  mechanical breakdown of the large egg pieces into smaller pieces  that can be swallowed. The salivary glands provide some saliva to  aid swallowing and the passage of the partially mashed egg through  the esophagus. The mashed egg pieces enter the stomach through  the esophageal sphincter. The stomach releases gastric juices  containing hydrochloric acid and the enzyme, pepsin, which initiate  the breakdown of the protein. The acidity of the stomach facilitates  the unfolding of the proteins that still retain part of their three- dimensional structure after cooking and helps break down the  protein aggregates formed during cooking. Pepsin, which is  secreted by the cells that line the stomach, dismantles the protein  chains into smaller and smaller fragments. Egg proteins are large  globular molecules and their chemical breakdown requires time  and mixing. The powerful mechanical stomach contractions churn  the partially digested protein into a more uniform mixture called  chyme. Protein digestion in the stomach takes a longer time than  carbohydrate digestion, but a shorter time than fat digestion. Eating  a high-protein meal increases the amount of time required to  sufficiently break down the meal in the stomach. Food remains in  the stomach longer, making you feel full longer.  From the Stomach to the Small Intestine  The stomach empties the chyme containing the broken down egg  pieces into the small intestine, where the majority of protein  digestion occurs. The pancreas secretes digestive juice that  contains more enzymes that further break down the protein  fragments. The two major pancreatic enzymes that digest proteins  Protein Digestion and Absorption  |  379\n",
            "are chymotrypsin and trypsin. The cells that line the small intestine  release additional enzymes that finally break apart the smaller  protein fragments into the individual amino acids. The muscle  contractions of the small intestine mix and propel the digested  proteins to the absorption sites. In the lower parts of the small  intestine, the amino acids are transported from the intestinal lumen  through the intestinal cells to the blood. This movement of  individual amino acids requires special transport proteins and the  cellular energy molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Once the  amino acids are in the blood, they are transported to the liver. As  with other macronutrients, the liver is the checkpoint for amino  acid distribution and any further breakdown of amino acids, which  is very minimal. Recall that amino acids contain nitrogen, so further  catabolism of amino acids releases nitrogen-containing ammonia.  Because ammonia is toxic, the liver transforms it into urea, which  is then transported to the kidney and excreted in the urine. Urea  is a molecule that contains two nitrogens and is highly soluble in  water. This makes it a good choice for transporting excess nitrogen  out of the body. Because amino acids are building blocks that the  body reserves in order to synthesize other proteins, more than 90  percent of the protein ingested does not get broken down further  than the amino acid monomers.  Amino Acids Are Recycled  Just as some plastics can be recycled to make new products, amino  acids are recycled to make new proteins. All cells in the body  continually break down proteins and build new ones, a process  referred to as protein turnover. Every day over 250 grams of protein  in your body are dismantled and 250 grams of new protein are  built.

Amino acids are used not only to build proteins,  but also to build other biological molecules containing nitrogen,  such as DNA, RNA, and to some extent to produce energy. It is  critical to maintain amino acid levels within this cellular pool by  consuming high-quality proteins in the diet, or the amino acids  needed for building new proteins will be obtained by increasing  protein destruction from other tissues within the body, especially  muscle. This amino acid pool is less than one percent of total body- protein content.

Collagen makes up 30 percent of bone tissue and comprises large  amounts of tendons, ligaments, cartilage, skin, and muscle. Collagen  is a strong, fibrous protein made up of mostly glycine and proline.  Within its quaternary structure three peptide strands twist around  each other like a rope and then these collagen ropes overlap with  others. This highly ordered structure is even stronger than steel  fibers of the same size. Collagen makes bones strong, but flexible.  Collagen fibers in the skin’s dermis provide it with structure, and the  accompanying elastin protein fibrils make it flexible. Pinch the skin  on your hand and then let go; the collagen and elastin proteins in  skin allow it to go back to its original shape. Smooth-muscle cells  that secrete collagen and elastin proteins surround blood vessels,  providing the vessels with structure and the ability to stretch back  after blood is pumped through them. Another strong, fibrous  protein is keratin, which is what skin, hair, and nails are made  of. The closely packed collagen fibrils in tendons and ligaments  allow for synchronous mechanical movements of bones and muscle  384  |  Protein’s Functions in the Body\n",
            "and the ability of these tissues to spring back after a movement is  complete.  Enzymes  Although proteins are found in the greatest amounts in connective  tissues such as bone, their most extraordinary function is as  enzymes. Enzymes are proteins that conduct specific chemical  reactions. An enzyme’s job is to provide a site for a chemical  reaction and to lower the amount of energy and time it takes for  that chemical reaction to happen (this is known as “catalysis”). On  average, more than one hundred chemical reactions occur in cells  every single second and most of them require enzymes. The liver  alone contains over one thousand enzyme systems. Enzymes are  specific and will use only particular substrates that fit into their  active site, similar to the way a lock can be opened only with a  specific key. Nearly every chemical reaction requires a specific  enzyme. Fortunately, an enzyme can fulfill its role as a catalyst  over and over again, although eventually it is destroyed and rebuilt.  All bodily functions, including the breakdown of nutrients in the  stomach and small intestine, the transformation of nutrients into  molecules a cell can use, and building all macromolecules, including  protein itself, involve enzymes (see Figure 6.10 “Enzymes Role in  Carbohydrate Digestion”).    Figure 6.10 Enzymes Role in Carbohydrate Digestion  Protein’s Functions in the Body  |  385\n",
            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  Hormones  Proteins are responsible for hormone synthesis. Hormones are the  chemical messages produced by the endocrine glands. When an  endocrine gland is stimulated, it releases a hormone. The hormone  is then transported in the blood to its target cell, where it  communicates a message to initiate a specific reaction or cellular  process. For instance, after you eat a meal, your blood glucose  levels rise. In response to the increased blood glucose, the pancreas  releases the hormone insulin. Insulin tells the cells of the body that  glucose is available and to take it up from the blood and store it  or use it for making energy or building macromolecules. A major  function of hormones is to turn enzymes on and off, so some  proteins can even regulate the actions of other proteins. While not  all hormones are made from proteins, many of them are.  Fluid and Acid-Base Balance  Proper protein intake enables the basic biological processes of the  body to maintain the status quo in a changing environment. Fluid  balance refers to maintaining the distribution of water in the body.  386  |  Protein’s Functions in the Body\n",
            "PDB 1o9x EBI  by Jawahar  Swaminatha n and MSD  staff at the  European  Bioinformati cs Institute /  Public  Domain The  butterfly-sha ped protein,  albumin, has  many  functions in  the body  including  maintaining  fluid and  acid-base  balance and  transporting  molecules.  If too much water in the blood suddenly moves into a tissue, the  results are swelling and, potentially, cell death. Water always flows  from an area of high concentration to one of a low concentration. As  a result, water moves toward areas that have higher concentrations  of other solutes, such as proteins and glucose. To keep the water  evenly distributed between blood and cells, proteins continuously  circulate at high concentrations in the blood. The most abundant  protein in blood is the butterfly-shaped protein known as albumin.  Albumin’s presence in the blood makes the protein concentration in  the blood similar to that in cells. Therefore, fluid exchange between  the blood and cells is not in the extreme, but rather is minimized to  preserve the status quo.  Figure 6.11 The Protein Albumin  Protein is also essential in maintaining proper pH balance (the  measure of how acidic or basic a substance is) in the blood. Blood  pH is maintained between 7.35 and 7.45, which is slightly basic.  Protein’s Functions in the Body  |  387\n",
            "Even a slight change in blood pH can affect body functions. Recall  that acidic conditions can cause protein denaturation, which stops  proteins from functioning. The body has several systems that hold  the blood pH within the normal range to prevent this from  happening. One of these is the circulating albumin. Albumin is  slightly acidic, and because it is negatively charged it balances the  many positively charged molecules, such as protons (H+), calcium,  potassium, and magnesium which are also circulating in the blood.  Albumin acts as a buffer against abrupt changes in the  concentrations of these molecules, thereby balancing blood pH and  maintaining the status quo. The protein hemoglobin also  participates in acid-base balance by binding and releasing protons.  Transport  Albumin and hemoglobin also play a role in molecular transport.  Albumin chemically binds to hormones, fatty acids, some vitamins,  essential minerals, and drugs, and transports them throughout the  circulatory system. Each red blood cell contains millions of  hemoglobin molecules that bind oxygen in the lungs and transport it  to all the tissues in the body. A cell’s plasma membrane is usually not  permeable to large polar molecules, so to get the required nutrients  and molecules into the cell many transport proteins exist in the  cell membrane. Some of these proteins are channels that allow  particular molecules to move in and out of cells. Others act as one- way taxis and require energy to function.

            "An enzyme called lysozyme is secreted in the saliva and attacks  the walls of bacteria, causing them to rupture. Certain proteins  circulating in the blood can be directed to build a molecular knife  that stabs the cellular membranes of foreign invaders. The  antibodies secreted by the white blood cells survey the entire  circulatory system looking for harmful bacteria and viruses to  surround and destroy. Antibodies also trigger other factors in the  immune system to seek and destroy unwanted intruders.  Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration  Proteins are involved in all aspects of wound healing, a process  that takes place in three phases: inflammatory, proliferative, and  remodeling. For example, if you were sewing and pricked your  finger with a needle, your flesh would turn red and become  inflamed. Within a few seconds bleeding would stop. The healing  process begins with proteins such as bradykinin, which dilate blood  vessels at the site of injury. An additional protein called fibrin helps  to secure platelets that form a clot to stop the bleeding. Next, in  the proliferative phase, cells move in and mend the injured tissue by  installing newly made collagen fibers. The collagen fibers help pull  the wound edges together. In the remodeling phase, more collagen  is deposited, forming a scar. Scar tissue is only about 80 percent  as functional as normal uninjured tissue. If a diet is insufficient in  protein, the process of wound healing is markedly slowed.  While wound healing takes place only after an injury is sustained,  a different process called tissue regeneration is ongoing in the body.  The  main  difference  between  wound  healing  and  tissue  regeneration is in the process of regenerating an exact structural  and functional copy of the lost tissue. Thus, old, dying tissue is  not replaced with scar tissue but with brand new, fully functional  tissue. Some cells (such as skin, hair, nails, and intestinal cells) have  a very high rate of regeneration, while others, (such as heart-muscle  Protein’s Functions in the Body  |  391\n",
            "cells and nerve cells) do not regenerate at any appreciable levels.  Tissue regeneration is the creation of new cells (cell division), which  requires many different proteins including enzymes that synthesize  RNA and proteins, transport proteins, hormones, and collagen. In  a hair follicle, cells divide and a hair grows in length. Hair growth  averages 1 centimeter per month and fingernails about 1 centimeter  every one hundred days. The cells lining the intestine regenerate  every three to five days. Protein-inadequate diets impair tissue  regeneration, causing many health problems including impairment  of nutrient digestion and absorption and, most visibly, hair and nail  growth.  Energy Production  Some of the amino acids in proteins can be disassembled and used  to make energy (Figure 6.14 “Amino Acids Used for Energy”). Only  about 10 percent of dietary proteins are catabolized each day to  make cellular energy. The liver is able to break down amino acids  to the carbon skeleton, which can then be fed into the citric acid  cycle. This is similar to the way that glucose is used to make ATP. If a  person’s diet does not contain enough carbohydrates and fats their  body will use more amino acids to make energy, which compromises  the synthesis of new proteins and destroys muscle proteins.  Alternatively, if a person’s diet contains more protein than the body  needs, the extra amino acids will be broken down and transformed  into fat.    Figure 6.14 Amino Acids Used for Energy  392  |  Protein’s Functions in the Body\n",

A healthy diet  incorporates all nutrients in moderation. Low protein intake has  several health consequences, and a severe lack of protein in the  diet eventually causes death. Although severe protein deficiency is  a rare occurrence in children and adults in the United States, it  is estimated that more than half of the elderly in nursing homes  are protein-deficient. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution  Range (AMDR) for protein for adults is between 10 and 35 percent  of kilocalories, which is a fairly wide range. The percent of protein  in the diet that is associated with malnutrition and its health  consequences is less than 10 percent, but this is often accompanied  by deficiencies in calories and other micronutrients. In this section  we will discuss the health consequences of protein intake that is  either too low to support life’s processes or too high, thereby  increasing the risk of chronic disease. In the last section of this  chapter, we will discuss in more detail the personal choices you can  make to optimize your health by consuming the right amount of  high-quality protein.  Health Consequences of Protein Deficiency  Although severe protein deficiency is rare in the developed world, it  is a leading cause of death in children in many poor, underdeveloped  countries. There are two main syndromes associated with protein  deficiencies: Kwashiorkor and Marasmus. Kwashiorkor affects  millions of children worldwide. When it was first described in 1935,  Diseases Involving Proteins  |  395\n",
            "more than 90 percent of children with Kwashiorkor died. Although  the associated mortality is slightly lower now, most children still  die after the initiation of treatment. The name Kwashiorkor comes  from a language in Ghana and means, “rejected one.” The syndrome  was named because it occurred most commonly in children who  had recently been weaned from the breast, usually because another  child had just been born. Subsequently the child was fed watery  porridge made from low-protein grains, which accounts for the low  protein intake. Kwashiorkor is characterized by swelling (edema) of  the feet and abdomen, poor skin health, growth retardation, low  muscle mass, and liver malfunction. Recall that one of protein’s  functional roles in the body is fluid balance. Diets extremely low  in protein do not provide enough amino acids for the synthesis  of albumin. One of the functions of albumin is to hold water in  the blood vessels, so having lower concentrations of blood albumin  results in water moving out of the blood vessels and into tissues,  causing swelling. The primary symptoms of Kwashiorkor include not  only swelling, but also diarrhea, fatigue, peeling skin, and irritability.  Severe protein deficiency in addition to other micronutrient  deficiencies, such as folate (vitamin B9), iodine, iron, and vitamin C  all contribute to the many health manifestations of this syndrome.

Children and adults with marasmus neither have enough protein  in their diets nor do they take in enough calories. Marasmus affects  mostly children below the age of one in poor countries.

Children with the combined  syndrome  have  variable  amounts  of  edema  and  the  characterizations and symptoms of marasmus. Although organ  system function is compromised by undernutrition, the ultimate  cause of death is usually infection. Undernutrition is intricately  linked with suppression of the immune system at multiple levels, so  undernourished children commonly die from severe diarrhea and/ or pneumonia resulting from bacterial or viral infection.

It is true that following  high-protein diets increases weight loss in some people. However  the number of individuals that remain on this type of diet is low  and many people who try the diet and stop regain the weight they  had lost. Additionally, there is a scientific hypothesis that there may  be health consequences of remaining on high-protein diets for the  long-term, but clinical trials are ongoing or scheduled to examine  this hypothesis further. As the high-protein diet trend arose so  did the intensely debated issue of whether there are any health  consequences of eating too much protein. Observational studies  conducted in the general population suggest diets high in animal  protein, specifically those in which the primary protein source is  red meat, are linked to a higher risk for kidney stones, kidney  disease, liver malfunction, colorectal cancer, and osteoporosis.  However, diets that include lots of red meat are also high in  saturated fat and cholesterol and sometimes linked to unhealthy  lifestyles, so it is difficult to conclude that the high protein content  is the culprit.  High protein diets appear to only increase the progression of  kidney disease and liver malfunction in people who already have  kidney or liver malfunction, and not to cause these problems.  However, the prevalence of kidney disorders is relatively high and  underdiagnosed. In regard to colon cancer, an assessment of more  than ten studies performed around the world published in the June  2011 issue of PLoS purports that a high intake of red meat and  processed meat is associated with a significant increase in colon  cancer risk.1Although there are a few ideas, the exact mechanism of  1. Chan DS, Lau R, et al.

            "how proteins, specifically those in red and processed meats, causes  colon cancer is not known and requires further study.  Some scientists hypothesize that high-protein diets may  accelerate bone-tissue loss because under some conditions the  acids in protein block absorption of calcium in the gut, and, once  in the blood, amino acids promote calcium loss from bone; however  even these effects have not been consistently observed in scientific  studies. Results from the Nurses’ Health Study suggest that women  who eat more than 95 grams of protein each day have a 20 percent  higher risk for wrist fracture.23  Other studies have not produced consistent results. The scientific  data on high protein diets and increased risk for osteoporosis  remains highly controversial and more research is needed to come  to any conclusions about the association between the two.4  http:/ /dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020456.

Protein Input = Protein Used by the Body + Protein Excreted  The appropriate amount of protein in a person’s diet is that which  maintains a balance between what is taken in and what is used. The  RDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance.  Nitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino  acids. When proteins are broken down and amino acids are  catabolized, nitrogen is released. Remember that when the liver  breaks down amino acids, it produces ammonia, which is rapidly  converted to nontoxic, nitrogen-containing urea, which is then  transported to the kidneys for excretion. Most nitrogen is lost as  urea in the urine, but urea is also excreted in the feces. Proteins are  also lost in sweat and as hair and nails grow. The RDA, therefore,  is the amount of protein a person should consume in their diet to  balance the amount of protein used up and lost from the body. For  healthy adults, this amount of protein was determined to be 0.8  grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. You can calculate  410  |  Proteins, Diet, and Personal Choices\n",
            "your exact recommended protein intake per day based on your  weight by using the following equation:  (Weight in lbs. ÷ 2.2 lb/kg) × 0.8 g/kg  Note that if a person is overweight, the amount of dietary protein  recommended can be overestimated.  The IOM used data from multiple studies that determined  nitrogen balance in people of different age groups to calculate the  RDA for protein. A person is said to be in nitrogen balance when the  nitrogen input equals the amount of nitrogen used and excreted. A  person is in negative nitrogen balance when the amount of excreted  nitrogen is greater than that consumed, meaning that the body is  breaking down more protein to meet its demands. This state of  imbalance can occur in people who have certain diseases, such  as cancer or muscular dystrophy. Someone who has a low-protein  diet may also be in negative nitrogen balance as they are taking in  less protein than what they actually need. Positive nitrogen balance  occurs when a person excretes less nitrogen than what is taken  in by the diet, such as during child growth or pregnancy. At these  times the body requires more protein to build new tissues, so more  of what gets consumed gets used up and less nitrogen is excreted. A  person healing from a severe wound may also be in positive nitrogen  balance because protein is being used up to repair tissues.  Dietary Sources of Protein  The protein food group consists of foods made from meat, seafood,  poultry, eggs, soy, dry beans, peas, and seeds. According to the  Harvard School of Public Health, “animal protein and vegetable  protein probably have the same effects on health. It’s the protein  package that’s likely to make a difference.”1  1. Protein: The Bottom Line. Harvard School of Public  Proteins, Diet, and Personal Choices  |  411\n",
            "Simply put, different protein sources differ in their additional  components, so it is necessary to pay attention to the whole  nutrient “package.” Protein-rich animal-based foods commonly  have high amounts of B vitamins, vitamin E, iron, magnesium, and  zinc. Seafood often contains healthy fats, and plant sources of  protein contain a high amount of fiber. Some animal-based protein- rich foods have an unhealthy amount of saturated fat and  cholesterol. When choosing your dietary sources of protein, take  note of the other nutrients and also the non-nutrients, such as  cholesterol, dyes, and preservatives, in order to make good  selections that will benefit your health. For instance, a hamburger  patty made from 80 percent lean meat contains 22 grams of protein,  5.7 grams of saturated fat, and 77 milligrams of cholesterol. A burger  made from 95 percent lean meat also contains 22 grams of protein,  but has 2.3 grams of saturated fat and 60 milligrams of cholesterol.  A cup of boiled soybeans contains 29 grams of protein, 2.2 grams of  saturated fat, and no cholesterol. For more comparisons of protein- rich foods, see Table 6.3 “Sources of Dietary Protein”.

            "Additionally, a person should consume 8 ounces of cooked seafood  every week (typically as two 4-ounce servings) to assure they are  getting the healthy omega-3 fatty acids that have been linked to a  lower risk for heart disease. Another tip is choosing to eat dry beans,  peas, or soy products as a main dish. Some of the menu choices  include chili with kidney and pinto beans, hummus on pita bread,  and black bean enchiladas. You could also enjoy nuts in a variety of  ways. You can put them on a salad, in a stir-fry, or use them as a  topping for steamed vegetables in place of meat or cheese. If you do  not eat meat, the USDA has much more information on how to get  all the protein you need from a plant-based diet. When choosing the  best protein-rich foods to eat, pay attention to the whole nutrient  package and remember to select from a variety of protein sources  to get all the other essential micronutrients.  Protein Quality  While protein is contained in a wide variety of foods, it differs in  quality. High-quality protein contains all the essential amino acids  in the proportions needed by the human body. The amino acid  profile of different foods is therefore one component of protein  quality. Foods that contain some of the essential amino acids are  called incomplete protein sources, while those that contain all nine  essential amino acids are called complete protein sources, or high- quality protein sources. Foods that are complete protein sources  include animal foods such as milk, cheese, eggs, fish, poultry, and  meat, and a few plant foods, such as soy and quinoa. The only  animal-based protein that is not complete is gelatin, which is made  of the protein, collagen.  Figure 6.18 Complete and Incomplete Protein Sources  414  |  Proteins, Diet, and Personal Choices\n",
            "Protein-rich  Foods by  Smastronard o / CC  BY-SA 4.0  Examples of complete protein sources include soy, dairy products,  meat, and seafood. Examples of incomplete protein sources include  legumes and corn.  Most plant-based foods are deficient in at least one essential  amino acid and therefore are incomplete protein sources. For  example, grains are usually deficient in the amino acid lysine, and  legumes are deficient in methionine or tryptophan. Because grains  and legumes are not deficient in the same amino acids they can  complement each other in a diet. Incomplete protein foods are  called complementary foods because when consumed in tandem  they contain all nine essential amino acids at adequate levels. Some  examples of complementary protein foods are given in Table 6.4  “Complementing Protein Sources the Vegan Way”. Complementary  protein sources do not have to be consumed at the same time—as  long as they are consumed within the same day, you will meet your  protein needs.  Table 6.4 Complementing Protein Sources the Vegan Way  Proteins, Diet, and Personal Choices  |  415\n",

In general, animal-based  proteins are completely broken down during the process of  digestion, whereas plant-based proteins are not. This is because  some proteins are contained in the plant’s fibrous cell walls and  these pass through the digestive tract unabsorbed by the body.  Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid  Score (PDCAAS)  The PDCAAS is a method adopted by the US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) to determine a food’s protein quality. It is  calculated using a formula that incorporates the total amount of  amino acids in the food and the amount of protein in the food that  is actually digested by humans. The food’s protein quality is then  ranked against the foods highest in protein quality. Milk protein, egg  whites, whey, and soy all have a ranking of one, the highest ranking.  Other foods’ ranks are listed in Table 6.5 “PDCAAS of Various Foods”.  Table 6.5 PDCAAS of Various Foods  416  |  Proteins, Diet, and Personal Choices\n",

We will take a closer look at the special  protein considerations for vegetarians, the elderly, and athletes.  Vegetarians and Vegans  People who follow variations of the vegetarian diet and consume  eggs and/or dairy products can meet their protein requirements  by consuming adequate amounts of these foods. Vegetarians and  vegans can also attain their recommended protein intakes if they  give a little more attention to high-quality plant-based protein  sources. However, when following a vegetarian diet, the amino acid  lysine can be challenging to acquire.

            "sources of lysine. Following a vegetarian diet and getting the  recommended protein intake is also made a little more difficult  because the digestibility of plant-based protein sources is lower  than the digestibility of animal-based protein.  To begin planning a more plant-based diet, start by finding out  which types of food you want to eat and in what amounts you should  eat them to ensure that you get the protein you need. The Dietary  Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) has analyzed how three  different, plant-based dietary patterns can meet the recommended  dietary guidelines for all nutrients.2  The diets are defined in the following manner:  • Plant-based. Fifty percent of protein is obtained from plant  foods.  • Lacto-ovo vegetarian. All animal products except eggs and  dairy are eliminated.  • Vegan. All animal products are eliminated.  These diets are analyzed and compared to the more common  dietary pattern of Americans, which is referred to as the USDA Base  Diet. Table 6.6 “Percentage of “Meat and Beans Group” Components  in the USDA Base Diet, and Three Vegetarian Variations” and Table  7.7 “Proportions of Milk Products and Calcium-Fortified Soy  Products in the Base USDA Patterns and Three Vegetarian  Variations” can be used to help determine what percentage of  certain foods to eat when following a different dietary pattern. The  percentages of foods in the different groups are the proportions  2. Jacobs DR, et al.

            "consumed by the population, so that, on average, Americans obtain  44.6 percent of their foods in the meat and beans group from meats.  If you choose to follow a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet, the meats,  poultry, and fish can be replaced by consuming a higher percentage  of soy products, nuts, seeds, dry beans, and peas. As an aside, the  DGAC notes that these dietary patterns may not exactly align with  the typical diet patterns of people in the United States. However,  they do say that they can be adapted as a guide to develop a more  plant-based diet that does not significantly affect nutrient  adequacy.

            "The Elderly  As we age, muscle mass gradually declines. This is a process referred  to as sarcopenia. A person is sarcopenic when their amount of  muscle tissue is significantly lower than the average value for a  healthy person of the same age. A significantly lower muscle mass  is associated with weakness, movement disorders, and a generally  poor quality of life. It is estimated that about half the US population  of men and women above the age of eighty are sarcopenic. A review  published in the September 2010 issue of Clinical Intervention in  Aging demonstrates that higher intakes (1.2 to 1.5 grams per  kilogram of weight per day) of high-quality protein may prevent  aging adults from becoming sarcopenic.3  Currently, the RDA for protein for elderly persons is the same as  that for the rest of the adult population, but several clinical trials are  ongoing and are focused on determining the amount of protein in  the diet that prevents the significant loss of muscle mass specifically  in older adults.

During exercise, especially when it is performed for  longer than two to three hours, muscle tissue is broken down and  some of the amino acids are catabolized to fuel muscle contraction.  To avert excessive borrowing of amino acids from muscle tissue to  synthesize energy during prolonged exercise, protein needs to be  obtained from the diet. Intense exercise, such as strength training,  stresses muscle tissue so that afterward, the body adapts by  building bigger, stronger, and healthier muscle tissue. The body  requires protein post-exercise to accomplish this. The IOM does  not set different RDAs for protein intakes for athletes, but the AND,  the American College of Sports Medicine, and Dietitians of Canada  have the following position statements4:  Nitrogen balance studies suggest that dietary protein intake  necessary to support nitrogen balance in endurance athletes  ranges from 1.2 to 1.4 grams per kilogram of body weight per  day.  Recommended protein intakes for strength-trained athletes  range from approximately 1.2 to 1.7 grams per kilogram of  weight per day.  An endurance athlete who weighs 170 pounds should take in 93  to 108 grams of protein per day (170 ÷ 2.2 × 1.2 and 170 ÷ 2.2 ×  1.4). On a 3,000-kilocalorie diet, that amount is between 12 and 14  4. American College of Sports Medicine, Academy of  Nutrition and Dietetics, and Dietitians of Canada. (2009).

There is general  scientific agreement that endurance and strength athletes should  consume protein from high-quality sources, such as dairy, eggs,  lean meats, or soy; however eating an excessive amount of protein  at one time does not further stimulate muscle-protein synthesis.  Nutrition experts also recommend that athletes consume some  protein within one hour after exercise to enhance muscle tissue  repair during the recovery phase, but some carbohydrates and  water should be consumed as well. The recommended ratio from  nutrition experts for exercise-recovery foods is 4 grams of  carbohydrates to 1 gram of protein.

However, this  raises another question: if athletes are more efficient at using  protein, is it necessary to take in more protein from dietary sources  than the average person? There are two scientific schools of  thought on this matter. One side believes athletes need more  protein and the other thinks the protein requirements of athletes  are the same as for nonathletes. There is scientific evidence to  support both sides of this debate. The consensus of both sides is  that few people exercise at the intensity that makes this debate  relevant. It is good to remember that the increased protein intake  recommended by the AND, American College of Sports Medicine,  and Dietitians of Canada still lies within the AMDR for protein.

            "Protein Supplements  Protein supplements include powders made from compounds such  as whey, soy or amino acids that either come as a powder or in  capsules. We have noted that the protein requirements for most  people, even those that are active, is not high. Is taking protein  supplements ever justified, then? Neither protein nor amino acid  supplements have been scientifically proven to improve exercise  performance or increase strength. In addition, the average  American already consumes more protein than is required. Despite  these facts, many highly physically active individuals use protein or  amino acid supplements. According to the AND, American College  of Sports Medicine, and Dietitians of Canada, “the current evidence  indicates that protein and amino acid supplements are no more or  no less effective than food when energy is adequate for gaining lean  body mass.”5  Branched-chain amino acids, such as leucine, are often touted  as a way to build muscle tissue and enhance athletic performance.  Despite these marketing claims, a review in the June 2005 issue of  The Journal of Nutrition shows that most studies that evaluated a  variety of exercise types failed to show any performance-enhancing  effects of taking branched-chain amino acids.6  5. American College of Sports Medicine, Academy of  Nutrition and Dietetics, and Dietitians of Canada.

            "Moreover, the author of this review claims that high-quality  protein foods are a better and cheaper source for branched-chain  amino acids and says that a chicken breast (100 grams) contains  the equivalent of seven times the amount of branched-chain amino  acids as one supplement tablet. This means if you are interested  in enhancing exercise performance or building muscle, you do not  need to support the $20 billion supplement industry.  Although the evidence for protein and amino acid supplements  impacting athletic performance is lacking, there is some scientific  evidence that supports consuming high-quality dairy proteins, such  as casein and whey, and soy proteins positively influences muscle  recovery in response to hard training. If you choose to buy a bucket  of whey protein, use it to make a protein shake after an intense  workout and do not add more than what is required to obtain 20  to 25 grams of protein. As always, choosing high-quality protein  foods will help you build muscle and not empty your wallet as  much as buying supplements. Moreover, relying on supplements  for extra protein instead of food will not provide you with any of  the other essential nutrients. The bottom line is that whether you  are an endurance athlete or strength athlete, or just someone who  takes Zumba classes, there is very little need to put your money  into commercially sold protein and amino acid supplements. The  evidence to show that they are superior to regular food in  enhancing exercise performance is not sufficient.  What about the numerous protein shakes and protein bars on  the market? Are they a good source of dietary protein? Do they  help you build muscle or lose weight as marketers claim?

            "before you ingest any supplement, do your homework. Read the  label, be selective, and don’t use them to replace meals, but rather  as exercise-recovery snacks now and then. Some protein bars have  a high amount of carbohydrates from added sugars and are not  actually the best source for protein, especially if you are not an  athlete. Protein bars are nutritionally designed to restore  carbohydrates and protein after endurance or strength training;  therefore they are not good meal replacements. If you want a low- cost alternative after an intense workout, make yourself a peanut  butter sandwich on whole-grain bread and add some sliced banana  for less than fifty cents.  Supermarket and health-food store shelves offer an extraordinary  number of high-protein shake mixes. While the carbohydrate count  is lower now in some of these products than a few years ago, they  still contain added fats and sugars. They also cost, on average, more  than two dollars per can. If you want more nutritional bang for your  buck, make your own shakes from whole foods. Use the AMDRs for  macronutrients as a guide to fill up the blender. Your homemade  shake can now replace some of the whole foods on your breakfast,  lunch, or dinner plate.

For thousands of years, alcohol has been consumed in a medicinal,  celebratory, and ritualistic manner. It is drunk in just about every  country and often in excessive amounts. Alcohol can be made from  a variety of different starch foods through the processes called  fermentation. Fermentation of a starchy food such as barley or  wheat can produce ethanol and CO2 which makes up what is  commonly known as beer. The Native Hawaiians distilled a mash of  fermented ti roots in iron try-pots pre-colonization in the 1700s.  This form of alcohol was called “Okolehao”.

In the United States,  the Dietary Guidelines define moderate alcohol intake as no more  than one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per  day for men.4 Although drunkenness has pervaded many cultures,  drinking in moderation has long been a mantra of multiple cultures  with access to alcohol.

A typical beer is 150 kilocalories, a  glass of wine contains approximately 80 kilocalories, and an ounce  of hard liquor (without mixer) is around 65 kilocalories.  As a person starts drinking alcohol, up to 5% of the ingested  ethanol is directly absorbed and metabolized by some of cells of the  gastrointestinal tract (the mouth, tongue, esophagus and stomach).  Up to 100% of the remaining ethanol travels in circulation. This is  one reason why blood tests are more accurate in measuring alcohol  levels.  The lungs and kidneys will excrete about 2% to 10% of this  circulatory ethanol. The more you drink the more quick trips to the  restroom.

Alcohol  metabolism  activates  an  enzyme  that  transforms  acetaminophen  into  a  toxic  metabolite  that  causes  liver  inflammation and damage. Liver damage may not be irreversible.  Instead, drink water with electrolytes or sport drinks to rehydrate  the body’s cells.  Alcohol is a volatile (flammable) organic substance and can be  converted to a gas. The lungs exhale alcohol as a gas. The more  alcohol consumed, the stronger the smell of alcohol in a person’s  breathe. Breathalyzer tests measure the exhaled alcohol levels in the  lungs to determine the state of inebriation.  The liver metabolizes up to 85% – 98% of the circulatory ethanol.  The liver uses two metabolic processes to get rid of this circulatory  ethanol as quickly and safely as possible.  1. Alcohol dehydrogenase system  2. Microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS)  Alcohol Dehydrogenase System  About 80 to 90% of the total hepatic ethanol uptake is processed  via the alcohol dehydrogenase system. The degradation of ethanol  begins in the liver. The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is called  alcohol dehydrogenase. The products from this reaction are  acetaldehyde, NADH (a reduced coenzyme that carries electrons  from one reaction to another)  and H+ ion. Acetaldehyde is very  toxic to the liver and the body’s cells. The moment acetaldehyde is  produced; it must be degraded to protect the liver cells. The enzyme  that will carry this type of degradation reaction is acetaldehyde  dehydrogenase (ALDH). Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase converts  acetaldehyde into acetate, a non-toxic molecule.  438  |  Alcohol Metabolism\n",
            "Microsomal Ethanol Oxidizing System  (MEOS)  In a moderate drinker, about 10 to 20% of the total liver ethanol  uptake is processed via the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system  (MEOS). During periods of heavy drinking, the MEOS system will  metabolize most of the excess ethanol ingested. Heavy drinking  stimulates the human body to include the MEOS system enzymes to  clear ethanol faster from the body.  The MEOS system is also located in the liver. Similar to the  Alcohol dehydrogenase system, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase will  immediately convert acetaldehyde into acetate, a non-toxic  molecule. Other products from this reaction are NADH and H+ ion.  Fate of Acetate  The acetate produced (from the alcohol dehydrogenase system and  microsomal ethanol oxidizing system) is either released into  circulation or retained inside the liver cells. In the liver cells, acetate  is converted to acetyl CoA where it is used to produce other  molecules like CO2 or used in the synthesis of fatty acids and  cholesterol.

However, alcohol displays its two-faced  character again in its effects on body weight, making many scientific  studies contradictory. Multiple studies show high intakes of hard  liquor are linked to weight gain, although this may be the result  of the regular consumption of hard liquor with sugary soft drinks,  juices, and other mixers. On the other hand drinking beer and, even  more so, red wine, is not consistently linked to weight gain and  in some studies actually decreases weight gain. The contradictory  results of scientific studies that have examined the association of  alcohol intake with body weight are partly due to the fact that  alcohol contributes calories to the diet. When alcohol is drunk in  excess, it reduces the secretion of pancreatic juice and damages the  lining of the gastrointestinal system, impairing nutrient digestion  and absorption. The impaired digestion and absorption of nutrients  in alcoholics contributes to their characteristic “skinniness” and  multiple associated micronutrient deficiencies. The most common  macronutrient deficiency among alcoholics is water, as it is  excreted  in  excess.  Commonly  associated  micronutrient  deficiencies include thiamine, pyridoxine, folate, vitamin A,  magnesium, calcium, and zinc. Furthermore, alcoholics typically  replace calories from alcohol with those of nutritious foods,  sometimes getting 50 percent or more of their daily caloric intake  from alcoholic beverages.  442  |  Health Consequences of Alcohol Abuse\n",
            "Effects of Alcohol Abuse on the Brain  A small amount (up to 10%) of the liver acetaldehyde may  accumulate inside the liver cells. As more alcohol is ingested, this  stimulates the production of acetaldehyde by both the alcohol  dehydrogenase and MEOS systems. As the levels of acetaldehyde  increase inside the liver cells with heavy consumption of alcohol,  some of the acetaldehyde diffuse into the blood circulation. In  circulation, high levels of acetaldehyde cause nausea and vomiting.  Vomiting causes more body dehydration and loss of electrolytes.  If the dehydration becomes severe enough, this can impair brain  function and a person may lose consciousness.  Alcohol can adversely affect nearly every area of the brain. When  BAC rises, the central nervous system is depressed. Alcohol disrupts  the way nerve cells communicate with each other by interfering  with receptors on certain cells. The immediate impact of alcohol  on the brain can be seen in the awkwardly displayed symptoms  of confusion, blurred vision, slurred speech, and other signs of  intoxication. These symptoms will go away once drinking stops,  but abusive alcohol consumption over time can lead to long-lasting  damage to the brain and nervous system. This is because alcohol  and its metabolic byproducts kill brain cells.  Effects of Excessive Alcohol on the Liver  Alcohol stimulates the release of epinephrine from the kidneys.  Epinephrine binds to receptors in the liver cells to stimulate the  release of glucagon from the pancreas. Glucagon and epinephrine  stimulate glycogenolysis in the liver cells. Epinephrine also  stimulates the breakdown of triglycerides and glycerol into free  fatty acids  in adipose tissue and are released into the bloodstream  and travel to the liver.  Health Consequences of Alcohol Abuse  |  443\n",
            "Cirrosi  Micronodula r by Amanda  Alvarez / CC  BY SY 4.0  A portion of these triglycerides are stored in the liver cells; while,  the remainder of these triglycerides are converted to very low  density lipoprotein (VLDL). The increased accumulation of both  stored triglycerides and VLDL particles inside the liver cells causes  a condition called fatty liver or hepatic steatosis. This can impair  normal liver function. The more alcohol consumed, the more lipids  produced and stored inside the liver cells. These effects are  cumulative over time.  According to the CDC, 14,406 Americans died from alcohol- related liver diseases in 2007. Although not every alcoholic or heavy  drinker will die from liver problems, the liver is one of the body’s  main filtering organs and is severely stressed by alcohol abuse.  The term Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD) is used to describe liver  problems linked to excessive alcohol intake. ALD can be progressive,  with individuals first suffering from a fatty liver and going on to  develop cirrhosis. It is also possible to have different forms of ALD  at the same time.  Figure 7.2 Liver Cirrhosis  Excessive alcohol consumption causes the destruction of liver cells.  444  |  Health Consequences of Alcohol Abuse\n",
            "In an attempt to repair itself, the liver initiates an inflammatory and  reparation process causing scar tissue to form. In the liver’s attempt  to replace the dead cells, surviving liver cells multiply. The result is  clusters of newly formed liver cells, also called regenerative nodules,  within the scar tissue. This state is called cirrhosis of the liver.  The three most common forms of ALD are:  • Fatty liver. A rather benign disorder that develops after  excessive alcohol consumption; however it can progress to  more fatal diseases. Fatty liver is reversible if alcohol use is  brought under control.  • Alcoholic hepatitis. The symptoms of this alcohol-induced liver  inflammation are a swollen liver, abdominal pain, nausea, fever,  jaundice, and vomiting. Although linked to alcohol use, even  people who drink moderately can sometimes develop this  condition, and not all alcohol abusers do. If a person stops  drinking alcohol, the liver damage can be reversed. But if they  continue, cirrhosis may develop and death can result.  • Cirrhosis. This serious and sometimes fatal form of ALD  develops when liver cells die and form scar tissue, which  blocks blood flow and causes wastes and toxins to build up in  the system. Strictly speaking, cirrhosis cannot be cured. It can,  however, be stopped with medical treatment and  complications can be managed if the individual stops drinking,  and many do survive. Not all cases of cirrhosis are strictly due  to alcoholism, and not all alcoholics develop the disease.  Symptoms of cirrhosis include the buildup of abdominal fluid  (ascites), abdominal pain, fever, thirst, confusion, and fatigue.

            "Stages of  Liver  Damage by  National  Digestive  Diseases  Information  Clearinghous e / Public  Domain  As the liver cells release VLDL particles into circulation, this  increases the levels of VLDL particles in blood. As VLDL particles  continue to accumulate in blood, this cause a condition called  hyperlipidemia. In their journey through circulation, VLDL particles  are eventually degraded to low density lipoproteins (LDL) particles.  LDL particles are also known as “bad cholesterol”. Higher levels  of LDL particles in circulation lead to the build-up of cholesterol  deposition plaques inside the walls of the blood vessels (known as  atherosclerosis). These plaques can impair or stop blood flow to the  cells. If an artery is blocked, the cells cannot make enough energy  and eventually stop working. If the artery remains blocked for more  than a few minutes, the cells may die. When a cardiac artery is  blocked, this causes a heart attack (acute myocardial infarction).  Depending on the length and severity of the blockage, damage to  the cardiac cells may be permanent and irreversible. Once the heart  structure and function is compromised, the more susceptible a  patient would be to suffer a second heart attack.  446  |  Health Consequences of Alcohol Abuse\n",

The data is most convincing  for preventing heart disease in middle-aged and older people. A  review of twenty-nine studies concluded that moderate alcohol  intake reduces the risk of coronary heart disease by about 30  percent in comparison to those who do not consume alcohol.1  Several other studies demonstrate that moderate alcohol  consumption reduces the incidences of stroke and heart attack, and  also death caused by cardiovascular and heart disease. The drop in  risk for these adverse events ranges between percent. Moreover,  there is some scientific evidence that moderate alcohol intake  reduces the risk for metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, and  gallstones. In addition to providing some health benefits, moderate  alcohol intake also serves as a digestive aid, a source of comfort and  relaxation, and inducing social interactions, thereby benefiting all  aspects of the health triangle.

Athletes  from Hawai‘i and across the world paddle from the island of Molokai  to Oahu in the Ka‘iwi Channel, whose name carries the meanings  of its two core words “the bones.” The channel is said to be one of  the most treacherous  bodies of water and depending on the ocean  conditions top paddlers finish between 3 1/2 and 6 hours.

Normal function of the human body  requires a constant input and output of energy to maintain life.  Various chemical components of food provide the input of energy to  the body. The chemical breakdown of those chemicals provides the  energy needed to carry out thousands of body functions that allow  the body to perform daily functions and tasks such as breathing,  walking up a flight of steps, and studying for a test.  Energy is classified as either potential or kinetic. Potential energy  is stored energy, or energy waiting to happen. Kinetic energy is  energy in motion. To illustrate this, think of an Olympic swimmer  standing at the pool’s edge awaiting the sound of the whistle to  begin the race. While he waits for the signal, he has potential  energy. When the whistle sounds and he dives into the pool and  begins to swim, his energy is kinetic (in motion).  In food and in components of the human body, potential energy  resides in the chemical bonds of specific molecules such as  carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and alcohol. This potential energy is  converted into kinetic energy in the body that drives many body  functions ranging from muscle and nerve function to driving the  synthesis of body protein for growth. After potential energy is  released to provide kinetic energy, it ultimately becomes thermal  energy or heat. You can notice this when you exercise and your  body heats up.  The Calorie Is a Unit of Energy  The amount of energy in nutrients or the amount of energy  expended by the body can be quantified with a variety of units  used to measure energy. In the US, the kilocalorie (kcal) is most  commonly used and is often just referred to as a calorie. Strictly  speaking, a kcal is 1000 calories. In nutrition, the term calories  Introduction  |  455\n",
            "almost always refers to kcals. Sometimes the kcal is indicated by  capitalizing calories as “Calories.”  A kilocalorie is the amount of  energy in the form of heat that is required to heat one kilogram of  water one degree Celsius.  Most other countries use the kilojoule (kJ) as their standard unit  of energy. The Joule is a measure of energy based on work  accomplished – the energy needed to produce a specific amount of  force. Since calories and Joules are both measures of energy, one  can be converted to the other – 1 kcal = 4.18 kJ.  Estimating Caloric Content  The energy contained in energy-yielding nutrients differs because  the energy-yielding nutrients are composed of different types of  chemical bonds. The carbohydrate or protein in a food yields  approximately 4 kilocalories per gram, whereas the triglycerides  that compose the fat in a food yield 9 kilocalories per gram. A  kilocalorie of energy performs one thousand times more work than  a calorie. On the Nutrition Facts panel found on packaged food, the  calories listed for a particular food are actually kilocalories.  Estimating the number of calories in commercially prepared food  is fairly easy since the total number of calories in a serving of a  particular food is listed on the Nutrition Facts panel. If you wanted  to know the number of calories in the breakfast you consumed  this morning just add up the number of calories in each food. For  example, if you ate one serving of yogurt that contained 150 calories,  on which you sprinkled half of a cup of low-fat granola cereal that  contained 209 calories, and drank a glass of orange juice that  contained 100 calories, the total number of calories you consumed  at breakfast is 150 + 209 + 100 = 459 calories.

An Organism Requires Energy and Nutrient  Input  Energy is required in order to build molecules into larger  macromolecules (like proteins), and to turn macromolecules into  organelles and cells, which then turn into tissues, organs, and organ  systems, and finally into an organism. Proper nutrition provides  the necessary nutrients to make the energy that supports life’s  processes. Your body builds new macromolecules from the  nutrients in food.  Nutrient and Energy Flow  Energy is stored in a nutrient’s chemical bonds. Energy comes from  sunlight, which plants capture and, via photosynthesis, use it to  transform carbon dioxide in the air into the molecule glucose. When  the glucose bonds are broken, energy is released. Bacteria, plants,  and animals (including humans) harvest the energy in glucose via a  biological process called cellular respiration. In this process oxygen  is required and the chemical energy of glucose is gradually released  in a series of chemical reactions. Some of this energy is trapped  in the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and some is lost as  heat. ATP can be used when needed to drive chemical reactions in  cells that require an input of energy. Cellular respiration requires  oxygen (aerobic) and it is provided as a byproduct of photosynthesis.  The byproducts of cellular respiration are carbon dioxide (CO2) and  water, which plants use to conduct photosynthesis again. Thus,  carbon is constantly cycling between plants and animals.

Food Quality  One measurement of food quality is the amount of nutrients it  contains relative to the amount of energy it provides. High-quality  foods are nutrient dense, meaning they contain lots of nutrients  relative to the amount of calories they provide. Nutrient-dense  foods are the opposite of “empty-calorie” foods such as carbonated  sugary soft drinks, which provide many calories and very little, if  any, other nutrients. Food quality is additionally associated with  its taste, texture, appearance, microbial content, and how much  consumers like it.  458  |  Introduction\n",

The structural  elements of an atom are protons (positively charged), neutrons (no  charge), and electrons (negatively charged). Protons and neutrons  are contained in the dense nucleus of the atom; the nucleus thus has  a positive charge. Because opposites attract, electrons are attracted  to this nucleus and move around it in the electron cloud.  Electrons contain energy, and this energy is stored within the  charge and movement of electrons and the bonds atoms make with  one another. However, this energy is not always stable, depending  on the number of electrons within an atom. Atoms are more stable  when their electrons orbit in pairs. An atom with an odd number  of electrons must have an unpaired electron. In most cases, these  unpaired electrons are used to create chemical bonds. A chemical  bond is the attractive force between atoms and contains potential  energy. By bonding, electrons find pairs and chemicals become part  of a molecule.  Bond formation and bond breaking are chemical reactions that  involve the movement of electrons between atoms. These chemical  reactions occur continuously in the body. We previously reviewed  how glucose breaks down into water and carbon dioxide as part of  cellular respiration. The energy released by breaking those bonds  is used to form molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Recall  how during this process electrons are extracted from glucose in a  stepwise manner and transferred to other molecules. Occasionally  electrons “escape” and, instead of completing the cellular  respiration cycle, are transferred to an oxygen molecule. Oxygen (a  molecule with two atoms) with one unpaired electron is known as  superoxide (Figure 8.2).  460  |  The Atom\n",
            "Image by  DoSiDo / CC  BY-SA 3.0  Atoms and molecules such as superoxide that have unpaired  electrons are called free radicals; those containing oxygen are more  specifically referred to as reactive oxygen species. The unpaired  electron in free radicals destabilizes them, making them highly  reactive. Other reactive oxygen species include hydrogen peroxide  and the hydroxyl radical.  Figure 8.2 Superoxide  A molecule with one unpaired electron, which makes it a free  radical.  The reactivity of free radicals is what poses a threat to  macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and fatty acids. Free  radicals can cause chain reactions that ultimately damage cells.  For example, a superoxide molecule may react with a fatty acid  and steal one of its electrons. The fatty acid then becomes a free  radical that can react with another fatty acid nearby. As this chain  reaction continues, the permeability and fluidity of cell membranes  changes, proteins in cell membranes experience decreased activity,  and receptor proteins undergo changes in structure that either alter  or stop their function. If receptor proteins designed to react to  insulin levels undergo a structural change it can negatively affect  glucose uptake. Free radical reactions can continue unchecked  unless stopped by a defense mechanism.  The Atom  |  461\n",
            "Metabolism Overview  Metabolism is defined as the sum of all chemical reactions required  to support cellular function and hence the life of an organism.  Metabolism is either categorized as catabolism, referring to all  metabolic processes involved in molecule breakdown, or anabolism,  which includes all metabolic processes involved in building bigger  molecules. Generally, catabolic processes release energy and  anabolic processes consume energy. The overall goals of  metabolism are energy transfer and matter transport. Energy is  transformed from food macronutrients into cellular energy, which  is used to perform cellular work. Metabolism transforms the matter  of macronutrients into substances a cell can use to grow and  reproduce and also into waste products. For example, enzymes are  proteins and their job is to catalyze chemical reactions. Catalyze  means to speed-up a chemical reaction and reduce the energy  required to complete the chemical reaction, without the catalyst  being used up in the reaction. Without enzymes, chemical reactions  would not happen at a fast enough rate and would use up too  much energy for life to exist. A metabolic pathway is a series of  enzyme catalyzed reactions that transform the starting material  (known as a substrate) into intermediates, that are the substrates  for subsequent enzymatic reactions in the pathway, until, finally,  an end product is synthesized by the last enzymatic reaction in  the pathway. Some metabolic pathways are complex and involve  many enzymatic reactions, and others involve only a few chemical  reactions.  To ensure cellular efficiency, the metabolic pathways involved in  catabolism and anabolism are regulated in concert by energy status,  hormones, and substrate and end-product levels. The concerted  regulation of metabolic pathways prevents cells from inefficiently  building a molecule when it is already available. Just as it would be  inefficient to build a wall at the same time as it is being broken  462  |  The Atom\n",

Catabolism of food molecules begins when food enters the mouth,  as the enzyme salivary amylase initiates the breakdown of the starch  in foods. The entire process of digestion converts the large  polymers in food to monomers that can be absorbed. Starches are  broken down to monosaccharides, lipids are broken down to fatty  acids, and proteins are broken down to amino acids. These  monomers are absorbed into the bloodstream either directly, as is  the case with monosaccharides and amino acids, or repackaged in  intestinal cells for transport by an indirect route through lymphatic  vessels, as is the case with most fatty acids and other fat-soluble  molecules.  Once absorbed, water-soluble nutrients first travel to the liver  which controls their passage into the blood that transports the  nutrients to cells throughout the body. The fat-soluble nutrients  gradually pass from the lymphatic vessels into blood flowing to body  cells. Cells requiring energy or building blocks take up the nutrients  from the blood and process them in either catabolic or anabolic  pathways. The organ systems of the body require fuel and building  blocks to perform the many functions of the body, such as digesting,  absorbing, breathing, pumping blood, transporting nutrients in and  wastes out, maintaining body temperature, and making new cells.

            "Energy metabolism refers more specifically to the metabolic  pathways that release or store energy. Some of these are catabolic  pathways, like glycolysis (the splitting of glucose), β-oxidation  (fatty-acid breakdown), and amino acid catabolism. Others are  anabolic pathways, and include those involved in storing excess  energy (such as glycogenesis), and synthesizing triglycerides  (lipogenesis). Table 8.1 “Metabolic Pathways” summarizes some of  the catabolic and anabolic pathways and their functions in energy  metabolism.

When energy levels are  high cells build molecules, and when energy levels are low catabolic  pathways are initiated to make energy. Glucose is the preferred  energy source by most tissues, but fatty acids and amino acids also  can be catabolized to release energy that can drive the formation  of ATP. ATP is a high energy molecule that can drive chemical  reactions that require energy. The catabolism of nutrients to release  energy can be separated into three stages, each containing  individual metabolic pathways. The three stages of nutrient  breakdown are the following:  464  |  The Atom\n",
            "“Aerobic  Production  Pathways” by  Boumphreyfr  / CC BY-SA  3.0  • Stage 1. Glycolysis for glucose, β-oxidation for fatty acids, or  amino-acid catabolism  • Stage 2. Citric Acid Cycle (or Krebs cycle)  • Stage 3. Electron Transport Chain and ATP synthesis  Figure 8.4 ATP Production Pathway  The breakdown of glucose begins with glycolysis, which is a ten- step metabolic pathway yielding two ATP per glucose molecule;  glycolysis takes place in the cytosol and does not require oxygen. In  addition to ATP, the end-products of glycolysis include two three- carbon molecules, called pyruvate. Pyruvate can either be shuttled  to the citric acid cycle to make more ATP or follow an anabolic  pathway. If a cell is in negative-energy balance, pyruvate is  transported to the mitochondria where it first gets one of its  carbons chopped off, yielding acetyl-CoA. The breakdown of fatty  acids begins with the catabolic pathway, known as β-oxidation,  which takes place in the mitochondria. In this catabolic pathway,  four enzymatic steps sequentially remove two-carbon molecules  from long chains of fatty acids, yielding acetyl-CoA molecules. In the  case of amino acids, once the nitrogen is removed from the amino  acid the remaining carbon skeleton can be enzymatically converted  into acetyl-CoA or some other intermediate of the citric acid cycle.  Acetyl-CoA, a two-carbon molecule common to glucose, lipid, and  protein metabolism enters the second stage of energy metabolism,  the citric acid cycle.  In the citric acid cycle, acetyl-CoA is joined to a four-carbon  molecule. In this multistep pathway, two carbons are lost as two  The Atom  |  465\n",
            "molecules of carbon dioxide. The energy obtained from the  breaking of chemical bonds in the citric acid cycle is transformed  into two more ATP molecules (or equivalents thereof) and high  energy electrons that are carried by the molecules, nicotinamide  adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide  (FADH2). NADH and FADH2 carry the electrons to the inner  membrane in the mitochondria where the third stage of energy  release takes place, in what is called the electron transport chain. In  this metabolic pathway a sequential transfer of electrons between  multiple proteins occurs and ATP is synthesized. The entire process  of nutrient catabolism is chemically similar to burning, as carbon  and hydrogen atoms are  combusted (oxidized) producing carbon  dioxide, water, and heat. However, the stepwise chemical reactions  in nutrient catabolism pathways slow the oxidation of carbon atoms  so that much of the energy is captured and not all transformed into  heat and light. Complete nutrient catabolism is between 30 and 40  percent efficient, and some of the energy is therefore released as  heat. Heat is a vital product of nutrient catabolism and is involved in  maintaining body temperature. If cells were too efficient at trapping  nutrient energy into ATP, humans would not last to the next meal, as  they would die of hypothermia (excessively low body temperature).  Anabolism: The Building  The energy released by catabolic pathways powers anabolic  pathways in the building of macromolecules such as the proteins  RNA and DNA, and even entire new cells and tissues. Anabolic  pathways are required to build new tissue, such as muscle, after  prolonged exercise or the remodeling of bone tissue, a process  involving both catabolic and anabolic pathways. Anabolic pathways  also build energy-storage molecules, such as Glycogen and  triglycerides. Intermediates in the catabolic pathways of energy  metabolism are sometimes diverted from ATP production and used  466  |  The Atom\n",
            "as building blocks instead. This happens when a cell is in positive- energy balance. For example, the citric-acid-cycle intermediate,  α-ketoglutarate can be anabolically processed to the amino acids  glutamate or glutamine if they are required. The human body is  capable of synthesizing eleven of the twenty amino acids that make  up proteins. The metabolic pathways of amino acid synthesis are  all inhibited by the specific amino acid that is the end-product of a  given pathway. Thus, if a cell has enough glutamine it turns off its  synthesis.  Anabolic pathways are regulated by their end-products, but even  more so by the energy state of the cell. When there is ample energy,  bigger molecules, such as protein, RNA and DNA, will be built as  needed. Alternatively, when energy is insufficient, proteins and  other molecules will be destroyed and catabolized to release energy.  A dramatic example of this is seen in children with marasmus, a  form of advanced starvation. These children have severely  compromised bodily functions, often culminating in death by  infection. Children with marasmus are starving for calories and  protein,  which  are  required  to  make  energy  and  build  macromolecules. The negative-energy balance in children who have  marasmus results in the breakdown of muscle tissue and tissues of  other organs in the body’s attempt to survive. The large decrease  in muscle tissue makes children with marasmus look emaciated or  “muscle-wasted.”  Figure 8.5 Metabolic Pathway of Gluconeogenesis  The Atom  |  467\n",
            "In a much less severe example, a person is also in negative-energy  balance between meals. During this time, blood-glucose levels start  to drop. In order to restore blood-glucose levels to their normal  range, the anabolic pathway, called gluconeogenesis, is stimulated.  Gluconeogenesis is the process of building glucose molecules  mostly from certain amino acids and it occurs primarily in the liver  (Figure 8.5 “Metabolic Pathway of Gluconeogenesis”). The liver  exports the synthesized glucose into the blood for other tissues to  use.  468  |  The Atom\n",
            "Energy Storage  In contrast, in the “fed” state (when energy levels are high), extra  energy from nutrients will be stored. Glucose is stored mainly in  muscle and liver tissues. In these tissues it is stored as glycogen, a  highly branched macromolecule consisting of thousands of glucose  molecules held together by chemical bonds. The glucose molecules  are joined together by an anabolic pathway called glycogenesis.  For each molecule of glucose stored, one molecule of ATP is used.  Therefore, it costs energy to store energy. Glycogen levels do not  take long to reach their physiological limit and when this happens  excess glucose will be converted to fat. A cell in positive-energy  balance detects a high concentration of ATP as well as acetyl-CoA  produced by catabolic pathways. In response, the rate of catabolism  is slowed or shut off and the synthesis of fatty acids, which occurs  by an anabolic pathway called lipogenesis, is turned on. The newly  made fatty acids are transported to fat-storing cells called  adipocytes where they are stored as triglycerides. Fat is a better  alternative to glycogen for energy storage as it is more compact (per  unit of energy) and, unlike glycogen, the body does not store water  along with fat. Water weighs a significant amount, and increased  glycogen stores, which are accompanied by water, would  dramatically increase body weight. When the body is in positive- energy balance, excess carbohydrates, lipids, and protein can all be  metabolized to fat.  The Atom  |  469\n",

Reversing and stopping obesity are  two different things. The former will require much more societal  and individual change than the latter.

This  benefits both health and safety.  • Watch less television.

A nutrient’s  metabolic path is dependent upon energy balance. When you are in  a positive energy balance the excess nutrient energy will be stored  or used to grow (e.g., during childhood, pregnancy, and wound  healing). When you are in negative energy balance you aren’t taking  in enough energy to meet your needs, so your body will need to use  its stores to provide energy. Energy balance is achieved when intake  of energy is equal to energy expended. Weight can be thought of as  a whole body estimate of energy balance; body weight is maintained  when the body is in energy balance, lost when it is in negative  energy balance, and gained when it is in positive energy balance.  In general, weight is a good predictor of energy balance, but many  other factors play a role in energy intake and energy expenditure.  Some of these factors are under your control and others are not. Let  476  |  Weight Management\n",

Then we will consider the other  factors that play a role in maintaining energy balance and hence,  body weight.  Estimating Energy Requirement  To maintain body weight you have to balance the calories obtained  from food and beverages with the calories expended every day.  Here, we will discuss how to calculate your energy needs in  kilocalories per day so that you can determine whether your caloric  intake falls short, meets, or exceeds your energy needs. The  Institute of Medicine has devised a formula for calculating your  Estimated Energy Requirement (EER). It takes into account your  age, sex, weight, height, and physical activity level (PA). The EER is  a standardized mathematical prediction of a person’s daily energy  needs in kilocalories per day required to maintain weight. It is  calculated for those over 18 years of age via the following formulas:  Adult male: EER = 662 − [9.53 X age (y)] + PA X [15.91 X wt (kg) +  5.39.6 X ht (m)]  Adult female: EER = 354 − [6.91 x age (y)] + PA x [9.36 x wt (kg) +  726 x ht (m)]  Note: to convert pounds to kilograms, divide weight in pounds by  2.2.

Total Energy Expenditure (Output)  The amount of energy you expend every day includes not only the  calories you burn during physical activity, but also the calories you  burn while at rest (basal metabolism), and the calories you burn  when you digest food. The sum of caloric expenditure is referred  to as total energy expenditure (TEE). Basal metabolism refers to  those metabolic pathways necessary to support and maintain the  body’s basic functions (e.g. breathing, heartbeat, liver and kidney  function) while at rest. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount  of energy required by the body to conduct its basic functions over  a certain time period. The great majority of energy expended  (between 50 and 70 percent) daily is from conducting life’s basic  processes. Of all the organs, the liver requires the most energy  480  |  Weight Management\n",
            "(Table 8.6 “Energy Breakdown of Organs”). Unfortunately, you  cannot tell your liver to ramp up its activity level to expend more  energy so you can lose weight. BMR is dependent on body size,  body composition, sex, age, nutritional status, and genetics. People  with a larger frame size have a higher BMR simply because they  have more mass. Muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue  even while at rest and thus the more muscle mass a person has, the  higher their BMR. Since females typically have less muscle mass and  a smaller frame size than men, their BMRs are generally lower than  men’s. As we get older muscle mass declines and thus so does BMR.  Nutritional status also affects basal metabolism. Caloric restriction,  as occurs while dieting, for example, causes a decline in BMR. This is  because the body attempts to maintain homeostasis and will adapt  by slowing down its basic functions to offset the decrease in energy  intake. Body temperature and thyroid hormone levels are additional  determinants of BMR.

The energy required for all the enzymatic reactions that take  place during food digestion and absorption of nutrients is called  the “thermic effect of food” and accounts for about 10 percent of  total energy expended per day. The other energy required during  the day is for physical activity. Depending on lifestyle, the energy  required for this ranges between 15 and 30 percent of total energy  expended. The main control a person has over TEE is to increase  physical activity.  How to Calculate Total Energy Expenditure  Calculating TEE can be tedious, but has been made easier as there  are now calculators available on the Web.

The hypothalamus in the brain is the main control point of  appetite. It receives hormonal and neural signals, which determine  if you feel hungry or full. Hunger is an unpleasant sensation of  feeling empty that is communicated to the brain by both mechanical  and chemical signals from the periphery. Conversely, satiety is the  sensation of feeling full and it also is determined by mechanical  and chemical signals relayed from the periphery. The hypothalamus  Factors Affecting Energy Intake  |  485\n",
            "Hypothalam us by  Methoxyroxy ~commonswi ki / Public  Domain  contains distinct centers of neural circuits that regulate hunger and  satiety (Figure 8.7).  Figure 8.7 Sagittal View of the Brain  This is a scan of a brain. The hypothalamus contains distinct centers  of neural circuits that regulate hunger and satiety.  Hunger pangs are real and so is a “growling” stomach. When the  stomach is empty it contracts, producing the characteristic pang  and “growl.” The stomach’s mechanical movements relay neural  signals to the hypothalamus, which relays other neural signals to  parts of the brain. This results in the conscious feeling of the need  to eat. Alternatively, after you eat a meal the stomach stretches and  sends a neural signal to the brain stimulating the sensation of satiety  and relaying the message to stop eating. The stomach also sends out  certain hormones when it is full and others when it is empty. These  hormones communicate to the hypothalamus and other areas of the  brain either to stop eating or to find some food.  Fat tissue also plays a role in regulating food intake. Fat tissue  produces the hormone leptin, which communicates to the satiety  center in the hypothalamus that the body is in positive energy  486  |  Factors Affecting Energy Intake\n",
            "balance. The discovery of leptin’s functions sparked a craze in the  research world and the diet pill industry, as it was hypothesized that  if you give leptin to a person who is overweight, they will decrease  their food intake. Alas, this is not the case. In several clinical trials  it was found that people who are overweight or obese are actually  resistant to the hormone, meaning their brain does not respond as  well to it.1  Therefore, when you administer leptin to an overweight or obese  person there is no sustained effect on food intake.  Nutrients themselves also play a role in influencing food intake.  The hypothalamus senses nutrient levels in the blood. When they  are low the hunger center is stimulated, and when they are high  the satiety center is stimulated. Furthermore, cravings for salty  and sweet foods have an underlying physiological basis. Both  undernutrition and overnutrition affect hormone levels and the  neural circuitry controlling appetite, which makes losing or gaining  weight a substantial physiological hurdle.  Genetic Influences  Genetics certainly play a role in body fatness and weight and also  affects food intake. Children who have been adopted typically are  similar in weight and body fatness to their biological parents.  Moreover, identical twins are twice as likely to be of similar weights  1. Dardeno TA, Chou, SH, et al.(2010).  Leptin in Human  Physiology and Therapeutics.

            "as compared to fraternal twins. The scientific search for obesity  genes is ongoing and a few have been identified, such as the gene  that encodes for leptin. However, overweight and obesity that  manifests in millions of people is not likely to be attributed to one  or even a few genes, but  the interactions of hundreds of genes  with the environment. In fact, when an individual has a mutated  version of the gene coding for leptin, they are obese, but only a  few dozen people around the world have been identified as having a  completely defective leptin gene.  Psychological/Behavioral Influences  When your mouth waters in response to the smell of a roasting  Thanksgiving turkey and steaming hot pies, you are experiencing  a psychological influence on food intake. A person’s perception of  good-smelling and good-tasting food influences what they eat and  how much they eat. Mood and emotions are associated with food  intake. Depression, low self-esteem, compulsive disorders, and  emotional trauma are sometimes linked with increased food intake  and obesity.  Certain behaviors can be predictive of how much a person eats.  Some of these are how much food a person heaps onto their plate,  how often they snack on calorie-dense, salty foods, how often they  watch television or sit at a computer, and how often they eat out. A  study published in a 2008 issue of Obesity looked at characteristics  of Chinese buffet patrons. The study found that those who chose to  immediately eat before browsing the buffet used larger plates, used  a fork rather than chopsticks, chewed less per bite of food, and had  higher BMIs than patrons who did not exhibit these behaviors.2  2. Levin BE.

            "Of course many behaviors are reflective of what we have easy  access to—a concept we will discuss next.  Societal Influences  It is without a doubt that the American society affects what and  how much we eat. Portion sizes have increased dramatically in the  past few decades. For example, a bagel is now more than twice the  size it was in the 1960s. Today, American teenagers have access  to a massive amount of calorie-dense foods and beverages, which  is a large contributor to the recent rapid increase in overweight  and obesity in adolescents in this country. Even different cultures  within the United States have different eating habits. For instance,  Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders who have since adopted the  western diet, post-colonization consume  foods high in fat, which is  a contributing factor to their higher incidences of overweight and  obesity.  The fast food industry in America not only supplies Americans  with a large proportion of their diet, but because of its massive  presence in society dominates the workings of the entire food  system. To generalize, most fast food items have little nutritional  merit as they are highly processed and rich in saturated fat, salt,  and added sugars. Despite fast foods being a poor source of  nourishment, Americans spend over one hundred billion dollars per  year on fast food, up from six billion dollars in the early 1970s. The  fast food business is likely to continue to grow in North America  Homeostasis and Obesity.

            "(and the rest of the world) and greatly affect the diets of whole  populations. Because it is unrealistic to say that Americans should  abruptly quit eating fast food to save their health (because they will  not) society needs to come up with ideas that push nutrient-dense  whole foods into the fast food industry. You may have observed  that this largely consumer-driven push is having some effect on the  foods the fast food industry serves (just watch a recent Subway  commercial, or check the options now available in a McDonald’s  Happy Meal). Pushing the fast food industry to serve healthier foods  is a realistic and positive way to improve the American diet.  Tools for Change  Support the consumer movement of pushing the fast food industry  and your favorite local restaurants into serving more nutrient- dense foods. You can begin this task by starting simple, such as  requesting extra tomatoes and lettuce on your burger and more  nutrient-dense choices in the salad bar. Also, choose their low- calorie menu options and help support the emerging market of  healthier choices in the fast food industry. In today’s fast-paced  society, it is difficult for most people to avoid fast food all the time.  When you do need a quick bite on the run, choose the fast food  restaurants that serve healthier foods. Also, start asking for caloric  contents of foods so that the restaurant becomes more aware that  their patrons are being calorie conscious.  490  |  Factors Affecting Energy Intake\n",

One theory is that every person has a “set point”  of energy balance. This set point can also be called a fat-stat or  lipostat, meaning the brain senses body fatness and triggers  changes in energy intake or expenditure to maintain body fatness  within a target range. Some believe that this theory provides an  explanation as to why after dieting, most people return to their  original weight not long after stopping the diet. Another theory is  referred to as the “settling” point system, which takes into account  (more so than the “set-point” theory) the contribution of the  obesogenic environment to weight gain. In this model, the reservoir  492  |  Factors Affecting Energy Expenditure\n",
            "of body fatness responds to energy intake or energy expenditure,  such that if a person is exposed to a greater amount of food, body  fatness increases, or if a person watches more television body  fatness increases. A major problem with these theories is that they  overgeneralize and do not take into account that not all individuals  respond in the same way to changes in food intake or energy  expenditure. This brings up the importance of the interactions of  genes and the environment.  Not all individuals who take a weight-loss drug lose weight and  not all people who smoke are thin. An explanation for these  discrepancies is that each individual’s genes respond differently  to a specific environment. Alternatively, environmental factors can  influence a person’s gene profile, which is exemplified by the effects  of the prenatal environment on body weight and fatness and disease  incidence later in life.1  One example is a study of the offspring of women who were  overweight during pregnancy had a greater propensity for being  overweight  and  for  developing  Type  2  diabetes.  Thus,  undernutrition and overnutrition during pregnancy influence body  weight and disease risk for offspring later in life. They do so by  adapting energy metabolism to the early nutrient and hormonal  environment in the womb.  1. Matthews CE, Chen KY, et al. (2008).

            "Psychological/Behavioral Influence  Sedentary behavior is defined as the participation in the pursuits in  which energy expenditure is no more than one-and-one-half times  the amount of energy expended while at rest and include sitting,  reclining, or lying down while awake. Of course, the sedentary  lifestyle of many North Americans contributes to their average  energy expenditure in daily life. Simply put, the more you sit, the  less energy you expend. A study published in a 2008 issue of the  American Journal of Epidemiology reports that 55 percent of  Americans spend 7.7 hours in sedentary behavior daily.2  Fortunately, including only a small amount of low-level physical  activity benefits weight control. A study published in the June 2001  issue of the International Journal of Behavioral Nutritionand  Physical Activity reports that even breaking up sitting-time with  frequent but brief increased energy expenditure activities, such as  walking for five minutes every hour, helps maintain weight and even  aids in weight loss.3  Americans partake in an excessive amount of screen time, which  is a sedentary behavior that not only reduces energy expenditure,  but also contributes to weight gain because of the exposure to  aggressive advertising campaigns for unhealthy foods.  2. Matthews CE, Chen KY, et al.

            "Societal Influence  In the United States, many societal factors influence the number of  calories burned in a day. Escalators, moving walkways, and elevators  (not to mention cars!) are common modes of transportation that  reduce average daily energy expenditure. Office work, high-stress  jobs, and occupations requiring extended working hours are all  societal pressures that reduce the time allotted for exercise of large  populations of Americans. Even the remote controls that many have  for various electronic devices in their homes contribute to the US  society being less active. More obesogenic factors were discussed in  the weight management section of this chapter.  Socioeconomic status has been found to be inversely proportional  to weight gain. One reason for this relationship is that inhabitants  of low-income neighborhoods have reduced access to safe streets  and parks for walking. Another is that fitness clubs are expensive  and few are found in lower-income neighborhoods. The recent and  long-lasting economic crisis in this country is predicted to have  profound effects on the average body weight of Americans. The  number of homeless in this country is rising with many children and  adults living in hotels and cars. As you can imagine neither of these  “home spaces” has a kitchen, making it impossible to cook nutritious  meals and resulting in increased economically-forced access to  cheap, unhealthy foods, such as that at a nearby gas station.  Too Little or Too Much Weight: What Are the  Health Risks?

            "that have more recently modernized, industrialized, and urbanized  are experiencing a surge in their overweight and obese populations.  China, the most populous country in the world, now has more than  215 million people, approximately one-fifth of their population, that  are considered overweight or obese.4  The increase in China’s waistline is partly attributed to changes  in the traditional diet, more sedentary lives, and a massive increase  in motor vehicle use. Moreover, China’s recent famines in the 1950s,  which affected the poor and lower classes to a greater extent than  the upper class, have sanctioned lax social attitudes toward body  fat and reinspired the age-old Chinese belief that excess body fat  represents health and prosperity.  One of the worst statistics regarding overweight and obesity in  China is that more than ten million adolescents between ages  seventeen and eighteen were overweight in 2000, which is twenty- eight times the number that were overweight in 1985.5  The associated diseases of overweight and obesity happen over  many years, and signs and symptoms commonly take decades to  manifest. With China’s younger population and other developed  countries experiencing a dramatic weight increase, the associated  chronic diseases will come about much earlier in life than in  previous generations. This will put an even greater burden on  society.  4. Wu Y. (2006). Overweight and Obesity in China.

The “Small-Change” Approach  Currently, most people are not obese in this country. The gradual  rise in overweight is happening because, on average, people  consume slightly more calories daily than they expend, resulting in  a gradual weight gain of one to two pounds a year. In 2003 the idea  was first published that promoting small lifestyle changes to reduce  weight gain occurring over time in all age groups may better reduce  obesity rates in the American population.10  Scientific studies have demonstrated that asking people to  increase the number of steps they take each day while providing  them with pedometers that count the steps they take each day  successfully prevented weight gain. A “small-changes” study  published in the October 2007 issue of Pediatrics evaluated whether  families that made two small lifestyle changes, which were to walk  an additional two thousand steps per day and to eliminate 100  kilocalories per day from their typical diet by replacing dietary sugar  with a noncaloric sweetener, would prevent weight gain in  10. Hill JO.

In 2009, a report of the Joint Task Force of the American Society  for Nutrition, Institute of Food Technologists, and International  Food Information Council proposed that the “small-changes”  approach when supported at the community, industry, and  governmental levels will be more effective than current strategies in  gradually reducing the obesity rate in America.13  11. Rodearmel SJ, Wyatt HR, et al.

However, due to a shift in dietary  patterns from fresh foods to processed and refined foods the island  is suffering from a magnitude of health concerns.

Vitamins are organic compounds that are traditionally assigned  to  two  groups  fat-soluble  (hydrophobic)  or  water-soluble  (hydrophilic). This classification determines where they act in the  body. Water-soluble vitamins act in the cytosol of cells or in  extracellular fluids such as blood; fat-soluble vitamins are largely  responsible for protecting cell membranes from free radical  damage. The body can synthesize some vitamins, but others must  be obtained from the diet.  Figure 9.1 The Vitamins  https:/ /www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14984164.  Accessed October 15, 2017.

            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  One major difference between fat-soluble vitamins and water- soluble vitamins is the way they are absorbed in the body. Vitamins  are absorbed primarily in the small intestine and their bioavailability  is dependent on the food composition of the diet. Fat-soluble  vitamins are absorbed along with dietary fat. Therefore, if a meal  is very low in fat, the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins will be  impaired. Once fat-soluble vitamins have been absorbed in the small  intestine, they are packaged and incorporated into chylomicrons  along with other fatty acids and transported in the lymphatic  system to the liver. Water-soluble vitamins on the other hand are  absorbed in the small intestine but are transported to the liver  through blood vessels.

            "Fat-Soluble Vitamins  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Vitamin A Functions and Health Benefits  Vitamin A is a generic term for a group of similar compounds called  retinoids. Retinol is the form of vitamin A found in animal-derived  foods, and is converted in the body to the biologically active forms  of vitamin A: retinal and retinoic acid (thus retinol is sometimes  referred to as “preformed vitamin A”). About 10 percent of plant- derived carotenoids, including beta-carotene, can be converted in  the body to retinoids and are another source of functional vitamin  A. Carotenoids are pigments synthesized by plants that give them  their yellow, orange, and red color. Over six hundred carotenoids  have been identified and, with just a few exceptions, all are found  in the plant kingdom. There are two classes of carotenoids—the  xanthophylls, which contain oxygen, and the carotenes, which do  not.  In plants, carotenoids absorb light for use in photosynthesis and  act as antioxidants. Beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta- cryptoxanthin are converted to some extent to retinol in the body.  The other carotenoids, such as lycopene, are not. Many biological  actions of carotenoids are attributed to their antioxidant activity,  but they likely act by other mechanisms, too.  Vitamin A is fat-soluble and is packaged into chylomicrons in  small intestine, and transported to the liver. The liver stores and  exports vitamin A as needed; it is released into the blood bound to a  retinol-binding protein, which transports it to cells. Carotenoids are  not absorbed as well as vitamin A, but similar to vitamin A, they do  require fat in the meal for absorption. In intestinal cells, carotenoids  Fat-Soluble Vitamins  |  521\n",
            "are packaged into the lipid-containing chylomicrons inside small  intestine mucosal cells and then transported to the liver. In the liver,  carotenoids are repackaged into lipoproteins, which transport them  to cells.  The retinoids are aptly named as their most notable function is  in the retina of the eye where they aid in vision, particularly in  seeing under low-light conditions. This is why night blindness is the  most definitive sign of vitamin A deficiency.Vitamin A has several  important functions in the body, including maintaining vision and a  healthy immune system. Many of vitamin A’s functions in the body  are similar to the functions of hormones (for example, vitamin A can  interact with DNA, causing a change in protein function). Vitamin A  assists in maintaining healthy skin and the linings and coverings of  tissues; it also regulates growth and development. As an antioxidant,  vitamin A protects cellular membranes, helps in maintaining  glutathione levels, and influences the amount and activity of  enzymes that detoxify free radicals.  Vision  Retinol that is circulating in the blood is taken up by cells in the  eye retina, where it is converted to retinal and is used to help  the pigment rhodopsin, which is involved in the eye’s ability to see  under low light conditions. A deficiency in vitamin A thus results in  less rhodopsin and a decrease in the detection of low-level light, a  condition referred to as night-blindness.  Insufficient intake of dietary vitamin A over time can also cause  complete vision loss. In fact, vitamin A deficiency is the number  one cause of preventable blindness worldwide. Vitamin A not only  supports the vision function of eyes but also maintains the  coverings and linings of the eyes. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to  the dysfunction of the linings and coverings of the eye (eg. bitot  spots),  causing  dryness  of  the  eyes,  a  condition  called  522  |  Fat-Soluble Vitamins\n",

            "The common occurrence of advanced xerophthalmia in children  who died from infectious diseases led scientists to hypothesize that  supplementing vitamin A in the diet for children with xerophthalmia  might reduce disease-related mortality. In Asia in the late 1980s,  targeted populations of children were administered vitamin A  supplements, and the death rates from measles and diarrhea  declined by up to 50 percent. Vitamin A supplementation in these  deficient populations did not reduce the number of children who  contracted these diseases, but it did decrease the severity of the  diseases so that they were no longer fatal. Soon after the results  of these studies were communicated to the rest of the world, the  World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations  Children’s Fund (UNICEF) commenced worldwide campaigns  against vitamin A deficiency. UNICEF estimates that the distribution  of over half a billion vitamin A capsules prevents 350,000 childhood  deaths annually.1  In the twenty-first century, science has demonstrated that  vitamin A greatly affects the immune system. What we are still  lacking are clinical trials investigating the proper doses of vitamin  A required to help ward off infectious disease and how large of  an effect vitamin A supplementation has on populations that are  not deficient in this vitamin. This brings up one of our common  themes in this text—micronutrient deficiencies may contribute to  the development, progression, and severity of a disease, but this  does not mean that an increased intake of these micronutrients will  solely prevent or cure disease. The effect, as usual, is cumulative and  depends on the diet as a whole, among other things.  1. Sommer A. (2008). Vitamin A Deficiency and Clinical  Disease: An Historical Overview.

            "Growth and Development  Vitamin A acts similarly to some hormones in that it is able to  change the amount of proteins in cells by interacting with DNA. This  is the primary way that vitamin A affects growth and development.  Vitamin A deficiency in children is linked to growth retardation;  however, vitamin A deficiency is often accompanied by protein  malnutrition and iron deficiency, thereby confounding the  investigation of vitamin A’s specific effects on growth and  development.  In the fetal stages of life, vitamin A is important for limb, heart,  eye, and ear development and in both deficiency and excess, vitamin  A causes birth defects. Furthermore, both males and females require  vitamin A in the diet to effectively reproduce.  Cancer  Vitamin A’s role in regulating cell growth and death, especially in  tissues that line and cover organs, suggests it may be effective in  treating certain cancers of the lung, neck, and liver. It has been  shown in some observational studies that vitamin A-deficient  populations have a higher risk for some cancers. However, vitamin  A supplements have actually been found to increase the risk of lung  cancer in people who are at high risk for the disease (i.e., smokers,  ex-smokers, workers exposed to asbestos). The Beta-Carotene and  Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) involving over eighteen thousand  participants who were at high risk for lung cancer found that people  who took supplements containing very high doses of vitamin A  (25,000 international units) and beta-carotene had a 28 percent  Fat-Soluble Vitamins  |  525\n",

Typically it  requires you to ingest ten times the RDA of preformed vitamin A in  the form of supplements (it would be hard to consume such high  levels from a regular diet) for a substantial amount of time, although  some people may be more susceptible to vitamin A toxicity at lower  doses. The signs and symptoms of vitamin A toxicity include dry,  itchy skin, loss of appetite, swelling of the brain, and joint pain. In  severe cases, vitamin A toxicity may cause liver damage and coma.  Vitamin A is essential during pregnancy, but doses above 3,000  micrograms per day (10,000 international units) have been linked  to an increased incidence of birth defects. Pregnant women should  check the amount of vitamin A contained in any prenatal or  pregnancy multivitamin she is taking to assure the amount is below  the UL.  2. Goodman GE, et al. (2004).

            "Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A  There is more than one source of vitamin A in the diet. There is  preformed vitamin A, which is abundant in many animal-derived  foods, and there are carotenoids, which are found in high  concentrations in vibrantly colored fruits and vegetables and some  oils.  Some carotenoids are converted to retinol in the body by  intestinal cells and liver cells. However, only minuscule amounts  of certain carotenoids are converted to retinol, meaning fruits and  vegetables are not necessarily good sources of vitamin A.  The RDA for vitamin A includes all sources of vitamin A. The  RDA for vitamin A is given in mcg of Retinol Activity Equivalent  (RAE) to take into account the many different forms it is available  in.  The human body converts all dietary sources of vitamin A into  retinol. Therefore, 1 mcg of retinol is equivalent to 12 mcg of beta- carotene, and 24 mcg of alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin.  For  example, 12 micrograms of fruit- or vegetable-based beta-carotene  will yield 1 microgram of retinol. Currently vitamin A listed in food  and on supplement labels use international units (IUs). The following  conversions are listed below3:  • 1 IU retinol = 0.3 mcg RAE  • 1 IU beta-carotene from dietary supplements = 0.15 mcg RAE  • 1 IU beta-carotene from food = 0.05 mcg RAE  • 1 IU alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin = 0.025 mcg RAE  3. Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Vitamin A.

Vitamin D Functions and Health Benefits  Vitamin D refers to a group of fat-soluble vitamins derived from  cholesterol. Vitamins D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (calcitriol) are the  only ones known to have biological actions in the human body.  The skin synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. In fact,  for most people, more than 90 percent of their vitamin D3 comes  from the casual exposure to the UVB rays in sunlight. Anything  that reduces your exposure to the sun’s UVB rays decreases the  amount of vitamin D3 your skin synthesizes. That would include  long winters, your home’s altitude, whether you are wearing  sunscreen, and the color of your skin (including tanned skin). Do you  ever wonder about an increased risk for skin cancer by spending too  much time in the sun? Do not fret. Less than thirty minutes of sun  exposure to the arms and legs will increase blood levels of vitamin  D3 more than orally taking 10,000 IU (250 micrograms) of vitamin  D3.

            "Vitamin D’s Functional Role  Activated vitamin D3 (calcitriol) regulates blood calcium levels in  concert with parathyroid hormone. In the absence of an adequate  intake of vitamin D, less than 15 percent of calcium is absorbed  from foods or supplements. The effects of calcitriol on calcium  homeostasis are critical for bone health. A deficiency of vitamin  D in children causes the bone disease nutritional rickets. Rickets  is very common among children in developing countries and is  characterized by soft, weak, deformed bones that are exceptionally  susceptible to fracture. In adults, vitamin D deficiency causes a  similar disease called osteomalacia, which is characterized by low  BMD. Osteomalacia has the same symptoms and consequences as  osteoporosis and often coexists with osteoporosis. Vitamin D  deficiency is common, especially in the elderly population, dark- skinned populations, and in the many people who live in the  northern latitudes where sunlight exposure is much decreased  during the long winter season.

In contrast, diets with high intakes of salmon,  which contains a large amount of vitamin D, are linked with better  bone health. A review of twelve clinical trials, published in the May  2005 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association,  concluded that oral vitamin D supplements at doses of 700–800  international units per day, with or without coadministration of  calcium supplements, reduced the incidence of hip fracture by 26  532  |  Fat-Soluble Vitamins\n",

Many other health benefits have been linked to higher intakes of  vitamin D, from decreased cardiovascular disease to the prevention  of infection. Furthermore, evidence from laboratory studies  conducted in cells, tissues, and animals suggest vitamin D prevents  the growth of certain cancers, blocks inflammatory pathways,  reverses atherosclerosis, increases insulin secretion, and blocks  viral and bacterial infection and many other things. Vitamin D  deficiency has been linked to an increased risk for autoimmune  diseases. Immune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,  and Type 1 diabetes have been observed in populations with  inadequate vitamin D levels. Additionally, vitamin D deficiency is  linked to an increased incidence of hypertension. Until the results  come out from the VITAL study, the bulk of scientific evidence  touting other health benefits of vitamin D is from laboratory and  observational studies and requires confirmation in clinical  intervention studies.

However, it is important to know that  the synthesis of vitamin D from the sun does not cause vitamin D  toxicity due to the skin production of vitamin D3 being a tightly  regulated process.

For adults, the RDA is 600 international units (IUs), which is  equivalent to 15 micrograms of vitamin D. The National  Osteoporosis Foundation recommends slightly higher levels and  that adults under age fifty get between 400 and 800 international  units of vitamin D every day, and adults fifty and older get between  800 and 1,000 international units of vitamin D every day. According  to the IOM, the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for vitamin D is  4,000 international units per day. Toxicity from excess vitamin D is  rare, but certain diseases such as hyperparathyroidism, lymphoma,  and tuberculosis make people more sensitive to the increases in  calcium caused by high intakes of vitamin D.

Vitamin E Functions and Health Benefits  Vitamin E occurs in eight chemical forms, of which alpha- tocopherol appears to be the only form that is recognized to meet  human requirements. Alpha-tocopherol and vitamin E’s other  constituents  are  fat-soluble  and  primarily  responsible  for  protecting cell membranes against lipid destruction caused by free  radicals, therefore making it an antioxidant. When alpha-tocopherol  interacts with a free radical it is no longer capable of acting as an  antioxidant unless it is enzymatically regenerated. Vitamin C helps  to regenerate some of the alpha-tocopherol, but the remainder is  eliminated from the body. Therefore, to maintain vitamin E levels,  you ingest it as part of your diet.  536  |  Fat-Soluble Vitamins\n",

People with malabsorption disorders, such as  Crohn’s disease or cystic fibrosis, and babies born prematurely, are  at higher risk for vitamin E deficiency.  Vitamin E has many other important roles and functions in the  body such as boosting the immune system by helping to fight off  bacteria and viruses.  It also enhances the dilation of blood vessels  and inhibiting the formation of blood clotting.  Despite vitamin E’s  numerous beneficial functions when taken in recommended  amounts, large studies do not support the idea that taking higher  doses of this vitamin will increase its power to prevent or reduce  disease risk.56  Fat in the diet is required for vitamin E absorption as it is  packaged into lipid-rich chylomicrons in intestinal cells and  transported to the liver. The liver stores some of the vitamin E or  packages it into lipoproteins, which deliver it to cells.  5. Goodman M, Bostlick RM, Kucuk O, Jones DP. (2011).

Vitamin K is critical for blood function acting  as coenzymes which play an essential role in blood coagulation (aka  blood clotting). Blood-clotting proteins are continuously circulating  in the blood. Upon injury to a blood vessel, platelets stick to the  wound forming a plug. Without vitamin K, blood would not clot.  A deficiency in vitamin K causes bleeding disorders. It is relatively  rare, but people who have liver or pancreatic disease, celiac disease,  or malabsorption conditions are at higher risk for vitamin K  deficiency. Signs and symptoms include nosebleeds, easy bruising,  broken blood vessels, bleeding gums, and heavy menstrual bleeding  in women.

Vitamins and minerals that  make up part of enzymes are referred to as coenzymes and  cofactors, respectively. Coenzymes and cofactors are required by  enzymes to catalyze a specific reaction. They assist in converting  a substrate to an end-product. Coenzymes and cofactors are  essential in catabolic pathways and play a role in many anabolic  pathways too. In addition to being essential for metabolism, many  vitamins and minerals are required for blood renewal and function.  At insufficient levels in the diet these vitamins and minerals impair  the health of blood and consequently the delivery of nutrients in  and wastes out, amongst its many other functions. In this section  we will focus on the vitamins that take part in metabolism and blood  function and renewal.  Figure 9.7 Enzyme Active Site for Cofactors  550  |  Water-Soluble Vitamins\n",

Vitamin C’s ability to easily  donate electrons makes it a highly effective antioxidant. It is  effective in scavenging reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen  species, and many other free radicals. It protects lipids both by  disabling free radicals and by aiding in the regeneration of vitamin  E.  In addition to its role as an antioxidant, vitamin C is a required  part of several enzymes like signaling molecules in the brain, some  hormones, and ]amino acids. Vitamin C is also essential for the  synthesis and maintenance of collagen. Collagen is the most  abundant protein in the body and used for different functions such  as the structure for ligaments, tendons, and blood vessels and also  scars that bind wounds together. Vitamin C acts as the glue that  Water-Soluble Vitamins  |  551\n",

Vitamin C is not stored in any significant  amount in the body, but once it has reduced a free radical, it is very  effectively regenerated and therefore it can exist in the body as a  functioning antioxidant for many weeks.  The classic condition associated with vitamin C deficiency is  scurvy. The signs and symptoms of scurvy include skin disorders,  bleeding gums, painful joints, weakness, depression, and increased  susceptibility to infections.

Overall, higher dietary intakes of vitamin C (via food intake,  not supplements), are linked to decreased disease risk. A review of  multiple studies published in the April 2009 issue of the Archives of  Internal Medicine concludes there is moderate scientific evidence  supporting the idea that higher dietary vitamin C intakes are  correlated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk, but there is  insufficient evidence to conclude that taking vitamin C supplements  influences cardiovascular disease risk.1 Vitamin C levels in the body  have been shown to correlate well with fruit and vegetable intake,  1. Mente A, et al.

As with  the studies on cardiovascular disease, the reduced risk of cancer  is the result of eating foods rich in vitamin C, such as fruits and  vegetables, not from taking vitamin C supplements. In these studies,  the specific protective effects of vitamin C cannot be separated  from the many other beneficial chemicals in fruits and vegetables.

Moreover, taking  megadoses (up to 4 grams per day) at the onset of a cold provides no  benefits.3  Gout is a disease caused by elevated circulating levels of uric acid  and is characterized by recurrent attacks of tender, hot, and painful  joints.

In fact, British sailors in the past were often referred  to as “limeys” as they carried sacks of limes onto ships to prevent  scurvy. Vitamin C is not found in significant amounts in animal- based foods.  Because vitamin C is water-soluble, it leaches away from foods  considerably during cooking, freezing, thawing, and canning.

            "Thiamin (B1 )  Thiamin is especially important in glucose metabolism. It acts as  a cofactor for enzymes that break down glucose for energy  production (Figure 9.7 “Enzyme Active Site for Cofactors” ). Thiamin  plays a key role in nerve cells as the glucose that is catabolized by  thiamin is needed for an energy source. Additionally, thiamin plays a  role in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and is therefore required  for RNA, DNA, and ATP synthesis.  The brain and heart are most affected by a deficiency in thiamin.  Thiamin deficiency, also known as beriberi, can cause symptoms  of fatigue, confusion, movement impairment, pain in the lower  extremities, swelling, and heart failure. It is prevalent in societies  whose main dietary staple is white rice. During the processing of  white rice, the bran is removed, along with what were called in  the early nineteenth century, “accessory factors,” that are vital for  metabolism. Dutch physician Dr. Christiaan Eijkman cured chickens  of beriberi by feeding them unpolished rice bran in 1897. By 1912, Sir  Frederick Gowland Hopkins determined from his experiments with  animals that the “accessory factors,” eventually renamed vitamins,  are needed in the diet to support growth, since animals fed a diet  of pure carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and minerals failed to  grow.4Eijkman and Hopkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in  Physiology (or Medicine) in 1929 for their discoveries in the  emerging science of nutrition.

Riboflavin (B2)  Riboflavin is an essential component of flavoproteins, which are  coenzymes involved in many metabolic pathways of carbohydrate,  lipid, and protein metabolism. Flavoproteins aid in the transfer of  electrons in the electron transport chain. Furthermore, the  functions of other B-vitamin coenzymes, such as vitamin B6 and  folate, are dependent on the actions of flavoproteins. The “flavin”  portion of riboflavin gives a bright yellow color to riboflavin, an  attribute that helped lead to its discovery as a vitamin.

Niacin (B3)  Niacin is a component of the coenzymes NADH and NADPH, which  are involved in the catabolism and/or anabolism of carbohydrates,  lipids, and proteins. NADH is the predominant electron carrier and  transfers electrons to the electron-transport chain to make ATP.  NADPH is also required for the anabolic pathways of fatty-acid  and cholesterol synthesis. In contrast to other vitamins, niacin can  be synthesized by humans from the amino acid tryptophan in an  anabolic process requiring enzymes dependent on riboflavin,  vitamin B6, and iron. Niacin is made from tryptophan only after  tryptophan has met all of its other needs in the body. The  contribution of tryptophan-derived niacin to niacin needs in the  body varies widely and a few scientific studies have demonstrated  that diets high in tryptophan have very little effect on niacin  deficiency. Niacin deficiency is commonly known as pellagra and  the symptoms include fatigue, decreased appetite, and indigestion.   These symptoms are then commonly followed by the four D’s:  diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and sometimes death.

Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)  Vitamin B12 contains cobalt, making it the only vitamin that contains  a metal ion. Vitamin B12 is an essential part of coenzymes. It is  necessary for fat and protein catabolism, for folate coenzyme  function, and for hemoglobin synthesis. An enzyme requiring  vitamin B12 is needed by a folate-dependent enzyme to synthesize  DNA. Thus, a deficiency in vitamin B12 has similar consequences  to health as folate deficiency. In children and adults vitamin B12  deficiency causes macrocytic anemia, and in babies born to  cobalamin-deficient mothers there is an increased risk for neural- 582  |  Water-Soluble Vitamins\n",

Cells in the stomach secrete a protein called intrinsic  factor that is necessary for vitamin B12 absorption, which occurs in  the small intestine. Impairment of secretion of this protein either  caused by an autoimmune disease or by chronic inflammation of  the stomach (such as that occurring in some people with H.pylori  infection), can lead to the disease pernicious anemia, a type of  macrocytic anemia. Vitamin B12 malabsorption is most common in  the elderly, who may have impaired functioning of digestive organs,  a normal consequence of aging. Pernicious anemia is treated by  large oral doses of vitamin B12 or by putting the vitamin under the  tongue, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream without passing  through the intestine. In patients that do not respond to oral or  sublingual treatment vitamin B12 is given by injection.

Low levels of vitamin  B12, folate or vitamin B6 will increase homocysteine levels therefore  increasing the risk of heart disease.  Figure 9.20 The Relationship Between Folate and Vitamin B12  When there is a deficiency in vitamin B12 , inactive folate (from  food) is unable to be converted to active folate and used in the  body for the synthesis of DNA. Folic Acid however (that comes from  supplements or fortified foods) is available to be used as active  folate in the body without vitamin B12 .Therefore, if there is a  deficiency in vitamin B12 macrocytic anemia may occur. With the  fortification of foods incorporated into people’s diets, the risk of an  individual developing macrocytic anemia is decreased.  584  |  Water-Soluble Vitamins\n",

Although some marketers claim taking a vitamin that contains one- thousand times the daily value of certain B vitamins boosts energy  and performance, this is a myth that is not backed by science.  The “feeling” of more energy from energy-boosting supplements  stems from the high amount of added sugars, caffeine, and other  herbal stimulants that accompany the high doses of B vitamins. As  discussed, B vitamins are needed to support energy metabolism and  growth, but taking in more than required does not supply you with  more energy. A great analogy of this phenomenon is the gas in your  590  |  Water-Soluble Vitamins\n",
            "car. Does it drive faster with a half-tank of gas or a full one? It does  not matter; the car drives just as fast as long as it has gas. Similarly,  depletion of B vitamins will cause problems in energy metabolism,  but having more than is required to run metabolism does not speed  it up. Buyers of B-vitamin supplements beware; B vitamins are not  stored in the body and all excess will be flushed down the toilet  along with the extra money spent.  B vitamins are naturally present in numerous foods, and many  other foods are enriched with them. In the United States, B-vitamin  deficiencies are rare; however in the nineteenth century some  vitamin-B deficiencies plagued many people in North America.  Niacin deficiency, also known as pellagra, was prominent in poorer  Americans whose main dietary staple was refined cornmeal. Its  symptoms were severe and included diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia,  and even death. Some of the health consequences of pellagra are  the result of niacin being in insufficient supply to support the body’s  metabolic functions.

Based on the antioxidant-supplement  industry’s success, the general public appears to believe these  health claims. However, these claims are not backed by scientific  evidence; rather, there is some evidence suggesting supplements  can actually cause harm. While scientists have found evidence  supporting the consumption of antioxidant-rich foods as a method  of reducing the risk of chronic disease, there is no “miracle cure”;  no pill or supplement alone can provide the same benefits as a  healthy diet. Remember, it is the combination of antioxidants and  other nutrients in healthy foods that is beneficial. In this section, we  will review how particular antioxidants function in the body, learn  how they work together to protect the body against free radicals,  and explore the best nutrient-rich dietary sources of antioxidants.

            "The Body’s Offense  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  While our bodies have acquired multiple defenses against free  radicals, we also use free radicals to support its functions. For  example, the immune system uses the cell-damaging properties of  free radicals to kill pathogens. First, immune cells engulf an invader  (such as a bacterium), then they expose it to free radicals such as  hydrogen peroxide, which destroys its membrane. The invader is  thus neutralized. Scientific studies also suggest hydrogen peroxide  acts as a signaling molecule that calls immune cells to injury sites,  meaning free radicals may aid with tissue repair when you get cut.  Free radicals are necessary for many other bodily functions as  well. The thyroid gland synthesizes its own hydrogen peroxide,  which is required for the production of thyroid hormone. Reactive  oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, which are free  radicals containing nitrogen, have been found to interact with  proteins in cells to produce signaling molecules. The free radical  nitric oxide has been found to help dilate blood vessels and act as a  chemical messenger in the brain. By acting as signaling molecules,  free radicals are involved in the control of their own synthesis,  stress responses, regulation of cell growth and death, and  metabolism.  Sources of Free Radicals in the  Environment  Substances and energy sources from the environment can add to or  accelerate the production of free radicals within the body. Exposure  The Body’s Offense  |  597\n",
            "to excessive sunlight, ozone, smoke, heavy metals, ionizing  radiation, asbestos, and other toxic chemicals increase the amount  of free radicals in the body. They do so by being free radicals  themselves or by adding energy that provokes electrons to move  between atoms. Excessive exposure to environmental sources of  free radicals can contribute to disease by overwhelming the free  radical detoxifying systems and those processes involved in  repairing oxidative damage.  Oxidative Stress  Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance in any cell, tissue, or organ  between the amount of free radicals and the capabilities of the  detoxifying and repair systems. Sustained oxidative damage results  only under conditions of oxidative stress—when the detoxifying and  repair systems are insufficient. Free radical-induced damage, when  left unrepaired, destroys lipids, proteins, RNA, and DNA, and can  contribute to disease. Oxidative stress has been implicated as a  contributing factor to cancer, atherosclerosis (hardening of  arteries), arthritis, diabetes, kidney disease, Alzheimer’s disease,  Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, emphysema,  and cataracts.  Aging is a process that is genetically determined but modulated  by factors in the environment. In the process of aging, tissue  function declines. The idea that oxidative stress is the primary  contributor to age-related tissue decline has been around for  decades, and it is true that tissues accumulate free radical-induced  damage as we age. Recent scientific evidence slightly modifies this  theory by suggesting oxidative stress is not the initial trigger for  age-related decline of tissues; it is suggested that the true culprit  is progressive dysfunction of metabolic processes, which leads to  increases in free radical production, thus influencing the stress  response of tissues as they age.  598  |  The Body’s Offense\n",

Carotenoids are one type of phytochemical.  Phytochemicals also include indoles, lignans, phytoestrogens,  stanols,  saponins,  terpenes,  flavonoids,  carotenoids,  anthocyanidins, phenolic acids, and many more. They are found not  only in fruits and vegetables, but also in grains, seeds, nuts, and  legumes.  Many phytochemicals act as antioxidants, but they have several  other functions, such as mimicking hormones, altering absorption  of cholesterol, inhibiting inflammatory responses, and blocking the  actions of certain enzymes.  Phytochemicals are present in small amounts in the food supply,  and although thousands have been and are currently being  scientifically studied, their health benefits remain largely unknown.  Also largely unknown is their potential for toxicity, which could be  substantial if taken in large amounts in the form of supplements.  Moreover, phytochemicals often act in conjunction with each other  and with micronutrients. Thus, supplementing with only a few may  impair the functions of other phytochemicals or micronutrients.  As with the antioxidant vitamins, it is the mixture and variety of  phytochemicals in foods that are linked to health benefits.    Table 9.33 Some Phytochemical’s Obtained from Diet and Their  Related Functions  600  |  Phytochemicals\n",

Minerals  are abundant in our everyday lives. From the soil in your front yard  to the jewelry you wear on your body, we interact with minerals  constantly. There are 20 essential minerals that must be consumed  in our diets to remain healthy.  The amount of each mineral found in  our bodies vary greatly and therefore, so does consumption of those  minerals. When there is a deficiency in an essential mineral, health  problems may arise.  Major minerals are classified as minerals that are required in the  diet each day in amounts larger than 100 milligrams. These include  sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and  sulfur. These major minerals can be found in various foods. For  example, in Guam, the major mineral, calcium, is consumed in the  diet not only through dairy, a common source of calcium, but also  through through the mixed dishes, desserts and vegetables that  they consume. Consuming a varied diet significantly improves an  individual’s ability to meet their nutrient needs.  1  Figure 10.1 The Major Minerals  1. Pobocik RS, Trager A, Monson LM. (2008).

Plant-based foods  often contain factors, such as oxalate and phytate, that bind to  minerals and inhibit their absorption. In general, minerals are better  absorbed from animal-based foods. In most cases, if dietary intake  of a particular mineral is increased, absorption will decrease. Some  minerals influence the absorption of others. For instance, excess  zinc in the diet can impair iron and copper absorption. Conversely,  certain vitamins enhance mineral absorption.

            "Calcium  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Calcium’s Functional Roles  Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body and greater than  99 percent of it is stored in bone tissue. Although only 1 percent of  the calcium in the human body is found in the blood and soft tissues,  it is here that it performs the most critical functions. Blood calcium  levels are rigorously controlled so that if blood levels drop the body  will rapidly respond by stimulating bone resorption, thereby  releasing stored calcium into the blood.  Thus, bone tissue sacrifices  its stored calcium to maintain blood calcium levels. This is why bone  health is dependent on the intake of dietary calcium and also why  blood levels of calcium do not always correspond to dietary intake.  Calcium plays a role in a number of different functions in the  body like bone and tooth formation. The most well-known calcium  function is to build and strengthen bones and teeth. Recall that  when bone tissue first forms during the modeling or remodeling  process, it is unhardened, protein-rich osteoid tissue. In the  osteoblast-directed process of bone mineralization, calcium  phosphates (salts) are deposited on the protein matrix. The calcium  salts typically make up about 65 percent of bone tissue. When your  diet is calcium deficient, the mineral content of bone decreases  causing it to become brittle and weak. Thus, increased calcium  intake helps to increase the mineralized content of bone tissue.  Greater mineralized bone tissue corresponds to a greater BMD,  and to greater bone strength. The remaining calcium plays a role  in nerve impulse transmission by facilitating electrical impulse  transmission from one nerve cell to another. Calcium in muscle cells  Calcium  |  613\n",
            "is essential for muscle contraction because the flow of calcium ions  are needed for the muscle proteins (actin and myosin) to interact.  Calcium is also essential in blood clotting by activating clotting  factors to fix damaged tissue.  In addition to calcium’s four primary functions calcium has  several other minor functions that are also critical for maintaining  normal physiology. For example, without calcium, the hormone  insulin could not be released from cells in the pancreas and  glycogen could not be broken down in muscle cells and used to  provide energy for muscle contraction.  Maintaining Calcium Levels  Because calcium performs such vital functions in the body, blood  calcium level is closely regulated by the hormones parathyroid  hormone (PTH), calcitriol, and calcitonin. When blood calcium levels  are low, PTH is secreted to increase blood calcium levels via three  different mechanisms. First, PTH stimulates the release of calcium  stored in the bone. Second, PTH acts on kidney cells to increase  calcium reabsorption and decrease its excretion in the urine. Third,  PTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that activate vitamin D to  calcitriol.  Calcitriol is the active hormone that acts on the intestinal  cells and increases dietary calcium absorption. When blood calcium  levels become too high, the hormone calcitonin is secreted by  certain cells in the thyroid gland and PTH secretion stops.  At higher  nonphysiological concentrations, calcitonin lowers blood calcium  levels by increasing calcium excretion in the urine, preventing  further absorption of calcium in the gut and by directly inhibiting  bone resorption.

            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  Other Health Benefits of Calcium in the  Body  Besides forming and maintaining strong bones and teeth, calcium  has been shown to have other health benefits for the body,  including:  • Cancer. The National Cancer Institute reports that there is  enough scientific evidence to conclude that higher intakes of  calcium decrease colon cancer risk and may suppress the  growth of polyps that often precipitate cancer. Although  higher calcium consumption protects against colon cancer,  some studies have looked at the relationship between calcium  and prostate cancer and found higher intakes may increase the  risk for prostate cancer; however the data is inconsistent and  more studies are needed to confirm any negative association.  • Blood pressure. Multiple studies provide clear evidence that  higher calcium consumption reduces blood pressure. A review  of twenty-three observational studies concluded that for every  Calcium  |  615\n",
            "100 milligrams of calcium consumed daily, systolic blood  pressure is reduced 0.34 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and  diastolic blood pressure is decreased by 0.15 mmHg.1  • Cardiovascular health. There is emerging evidence that higher  calcium intakes prevent against other risk factors for  cardiovascular disease, such as high cholesterol and obesity,  but the scientific evidence is weak or inconclusive.  • Kidney stones. Another health benefit of a high-calcium diet is  that it blocks kidney stone formation. Calcium inhibits the  absorption of oxalate, a chemical in plants such as parsley and  spinach, which is associated with an increased risk for  developing kidney stones. Calcium’s protective effects on  kidney stone formation occur only when you obtain calcium  from dietary sources. Calcium supplements may actually  increase the risk for kidney stones in susceptible people.  Figure 10. 3 Calcium’s Effect on Aging  1. Birkett NJ. (1998).

Here we will take a closer look at particular groups of people  who may require extra calcium intake.  • Adolescent teens. A calcium-deficient diet is common in  teenage girls as their dairy consumption often considerably  drops during adolescence.  • Amenorrheic women and the “female athlete triad“.  Amenorrhea refers to the absence of a menstrual cycle.  Women who fail to menstruate suffer from reduced estrogen  levels, which can disrupt and have a negative impact on the  calcium balance in their bodies. The “female athlete triad” is a  combination of three conditions characterized by amenorrhea,  disrupted eating patterns, and osteoporosis. Exercise-induced  amenorrhea and anorexia nervosa-related amenorrhea can  decrease bone mass.23 In female athletes, as well as active  women in the military, low BMD, menstrual irregularities, and  individual dietary habits together with a history of previous  2. Drinkwater B, Bruemner B, Chesnut C.

As people age, calcium bioavailability is reduced,  the kidneys lose their capacity to convert vitamin D to its most  active form, the kidneys are no longer efficient in retaining  calcium, the skin is less effective at synthesizing vitamin D,  there are changes in overall dietary patterns, and older people  tend to get less exposure to sunlight. Thus the risk for calcium  inadequacy is great.6  • Postmenopausal women. Estrogen enhances calcium  absorption.

After  age sixty-five, decreases are typically less than 1 percent.7  • Lactose-intolerant people. Groups of people, such as those  who are lactose intolerant, or who adhere to diets that avoid  dairy products, may not have an adequate calcium intake.  • Vegans. Vegans typically absorb reduced amounts of calcium  because their diets favor plant-based foods that contain  oxalates and phytates.8  In addition, because vegans avoid dairy products, their overall  consumption of calcium-rich foods may be less.  If you are lactose intolerant, have a milk allergy, are a vegan, or  you simply do not like dairy products, remember that there are  many plant-based foods that have a good amount of calcium and  there are also some low-lactose and lactose-free dairy products on  the market.

It is important to note that calcium carbonate  requires an acidic environment in the stomach to be used  effectively. Although this is not a problem for most people, it may  be for those on medication to reduce stomach-acid production or  for the elderly who may have a reduced ability to secrete acid in the  stomach. For these people, calcium citrate may be a better choice.  Otherwise, calcium carbonate is the cheapest. The body is capable  of absorbing approximately 30 percent of the calcium from these  forms.  Beware of Lead  There is public health concern about the lead content of some  brands of calcium supplements, as supplements derived from  natural sources such as oyster shell, bone meal, and dolomite (a  type of rock containing calcium magnesium carbonate) are known  to contain high amounts of lead. In one study conducted on twenty- two brands of calcium supplements, it was proven that eight of the  brands exceeded the acceptable limit for lead content. This was  found to be the case in supplements derived from oyster shell and  refined calcium carbonate. The same study also found that brands  claiming to be lead-free did, in fact, show very low lead levels.  Because lead levels in supplements are not disclosed on labels, it  is important to know that products not derived from oyster shell  or other natural substances are generally low in lead content. In  addition, it was also found that one brand did not disintegrate as is  necessary for absorption, and one brand contained only 77 percent  of the stated calcium content.9  9. Ross EA, Szabo NJ, Tebbett IR.

            "Diet, Supplements, and Chelated Supplements  In general, calcium supplements perform to a lesser degree than  dietary sources of calcium in providing many of the health benefits  linked to higher calcium intake. This is partly attributed to the fact  that dietary sources of calcium supply additional nutrients with  health-promoting activities. It is reported that chelated forms of  calcium supplements are easier to absorb as the chelation process  protects the calcium from oxalates and phytates that may bind with  the calcium in the intestines. However, these are more expensive  supplements and only increase calcium absorption up to 10 percent.  In people with low dietary intakes of calcium, calcium supplements  have a negligible benefit on bone health in the absence of a vitamin  D supplement. However, when calcium supplements are taken along  with vitamin D, there are many benefits to bone health: peak bone  mass is increased in early adulthood, BMD is maintained throughout  adulthood, the risk of developing osteoporosis is reduced, and the  incidence of fractures is decreased in those who already had  osteoporosis. Calcium and vitamin D pills do not have to be taken at  the same time for effectiveness. But remember that vitamin D has to  be activated and in the bloodstream to promote calcium absorption.  Thus, it is important to maintain an adequate intake of vitamin D.

            "greater than 500 milligrams per day in the absence of a vitamin  D supplement had a 30 percent greater risk for having a heart  attack.10  Does this mean that calcium supplements are bad for you? If  you look more closely at the study, you will find that 5.8 percent  of people (143 people) who took calcium supplements had a heart  attack, but so did 5.5 percent of the people (111) people who took  the placebo. While this is one study, several other large studies  have not shown that calcium supplementation increases the risk for  cardiovascular disease. While the debate over this continues in the  realm of science, we should focus on the things we do know:  1. There is overwhelming evidence that diets sufficient in  calcium prevent osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.  2. People with risk factors for osteoporosis are advised to take  calcium supplements if they are unable to get enough calcium  in their diet. The National Osteoporosis Foundation advises  that adults age fifty and above consume 1,200 milligrams of  calcium per day. This includes calcium both from dietary  sources and supplements.  3. Consuming more calcium than is recommended is not better  for your health and can prove to be detrimental. Consuming  too much calcium at any one time, be it from diet or  supplements, impairs not only the absorption of calcium itself,  but also the absorption of other essential minerals, such as  iron and zinc. Since the GI tract can only handle about 500  milligrams of calcium at one time, it is recommended to have  split doses of calcium supplements rather than taking a few all  10. Bolland MJ. et al.

Dietary Reference Intake for Calcium  The recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for calcium are listed  in Table 10.1 “Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium”. The RDA is  elevated to 1,300 milligrams per day during adolescence because  this is the life stage with accelerated bone growth. Studies have  shown that a higher intake of calcium during puberty increases  the total amount of bone tissue that accumulates in a person. For  women above age fifty and men older than seventy-one, the RDAs  are also a bit higher for several reasons including that as we age,  calcium absorption in the gut decreases, vitamin D3 activation is  reduced, and maintaining adequate blood levels of calcium is  important to prevent an acceleration of bone tissue loss (especially  during menopause). Currently, the dietary intake of calcium for  females above age nine is, on average, below the RDA for calcium.  The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends that people do not  consume over 2,500 milligrams per day of calcium as it may cause  adverse effects in some people.

Dietary Sources of Calcium  In the typical American diet, calcium is obtained mostly from dairy  products, primarily cheese. A slice of cheddar or Swiss cheese  contains just over 200 milligrams of calcium. One cup of nonfat milk  contains approximately 300 milligrams of calcium, which is about  a third of the RDA for calcium for most adults. Foods fortified with  calcium such as cereals, soy milk, and orange juice also provide one  third or greater of the calcium RDA. Although the typical American  diet relies mostly on dairy products for obtaining calcium, there are  other good non-dairy sources of calcium.    Calcium  |  625\n",
            "Tools for Change  If you need to increase calcium intake, are a vegan, or  have a food allergy to dairy products, it is helpful to know  that there are some plant-based foods that are high in  calcium. Tofu (made with calcium sulfate), turnip greens,  mustard greens, and chinese cabbage are good sources. For  a list of non-dairy sources you can find the calcium content  for thousands of foods by visiting the USDA National  Nutrient Database (http:/ /www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/ foodcomp/search/). When obtaining your calcium from a  vegan diet, it is important to know that some plant-based  foods significantly impair the absorption of calcium. These  include spinach, Swiss chard, rhubarb, beets, cashews, and  peanuts. With careful planning and good selections, you  can ensure that you are getting enough calcium in your diet  even if you do not drink milk or consume other dairy  products.  Calcium Bioavailability  In the small intestine, calcium absorption primarily takes place in  the duodenum (first section of the small intestine) when intakes  are low, but calcium is also absorbed passively in the jejunum and  ileum (second and third sections of the small intestine), especially  when intakes are higher. The body doesn’t completely absorb all the  calcium in food. Interestingly, the calcium in some vegetables such  as kale, brussel sprouts, and bok choy is better absorbed by the body  626  |  Calcium\n",
            "than are dairy products. About 30 percent of calcium is absorbed  from milk and other dairy products.  The greatest positive influence on calcium absorption comes  from having an adequate intake of vitamin D. People deficient in  vitamin D absorb less than 15 percent of calcium from the foods they  eat. The hormone estrogen is another factor that enhances calcium  bioavailability. Thus, as a woman ages and goes through menopause,  during which estrogen levels fall, the amount of calcium absorbed  decreases and the risk for bone disease increases. Some fibers, such  as inulin, found in jicama, onions, and garlic, also promote calcium  intestinal uptake.  Chemicals that bind to calcium decrease its bioavailability. These  negative effectors of calcium absorption include the oxalates in  certain plants, the tannins in tea, phytates in nuts, seeds, and grains,  and some fibers. Oxalates are found in high concentrations in  spinach, parsley, cocoa, and beets. In general, the calcium  bioavailability is inversely correlated to the oxalate content in foods.  High-fiber, low-fat diets also decrease the amount of calcium  absorbed, an effect likely related to how fiber and fat influence  the amount of time food stays in the gut. Anything that causes  diarrhea, including sickness, medications, and certain symptoms  related to old age, decreases the transit time of calcium in the  gut and therefore decreases calcium absorption. As we get older,  stomach acidity sometimes decreases, diarrhea occurs more often,  kidney function is impaired, and vitamin D absorption and activation  is compromised, all of which contribute to a decrease in calcium  bioavailability.    Table 10.2 Calcium Content and Bioavailability of Various Foods  Calcium  |  627\n",

These phosphate groups are essential  as a structural component of cell membranes (as phospholipids),  DNA and RNA, energy production (ATP), and regulation of acid- base homeostasis. Phosphorus however is mostly associated with  calcium as a part of the mineral structure of bones and teeth.  Blood  phosphorus levels are not controlled as strictly as calcium so the  PTH stimulates renal excretion of phosphate so that it does not  accumulate to toxic levels.  Dietary Reference Intakes for Phosphorus  In comparison to calcium, most Americans are not at risk for having  a phosphate deficiency. Phosphate is present in many foods popular  in the American diet including meat, fish, dairy products, processed  foods, and beverages. Phosphate is added to many foods because it  acts as an emulsifying agent, prevents clumping, improves texture  and taste, and extends shelf-life. The average intake of phosphorus  in US adults ranges between 1,000 and 1,500 milligrams per day,  well above the RDA of 700 milligrams per day.

Magnesium is not an integral part of the hard mineral  crystals, but it does reside on the surface of the crystal and helps  maximize bone structure. Observational studies link magnesium  deficiency with an increased risk for osteoporosis. A magnesium- deficient diet is associated with decreased levels of parathyroid  hormone and the activation of vitamin D, which may lead to an  impairment of bone remodeling. A study in nine hundred elderly  women and men did show that higher dietary intakes of magnesium  correlated to an increased BMD in the hip.1 Only a few clinical  trials have evaluated the effects of magnesium supplements on bone  health and their results suggest some modest benefits on BMD.  In addition to participating in bone maintenance, magnesium has  several other functions in the body.

Iodine deficiency is a major  concern in countries around the world such as Fiji.  In the 1990’s,  almost 50% of the population had signs of iodine deficiency also  known as goiter. To combat this national issue, the government  of Fiji banned non-iodized salt and allowed only fortified iodized  salt into the country in hopes of increasing the consumption of  iodine in people’s diets.  With this law, and health promotion efforts  encouraging the consumption of seafood, great progress has been  made in decreasing the prevalence of iodine deficiency in Fiji.1  Figure 11.1 The Trace Minerals  1. Micronutrient Deficiencies.

It  is composed of four globular peptides, each containing a heme  complex. In the center of each heme, lies iron (Figure 11.2). Iron is  needed for the production of other iron-containing proteins such as  myoglobin.  Myoglobin is a protein found in the muscle tissues that  enhances the amount of available oxygen for muscle contraction.  Iron is also a key component of hundreds of metabolic enzymes.  Many of the proteins of the electron-transport chain contain  iron–sulfur clusters involved in the transfer of high-energy  electrons and ultimately ATP synthesis. Iron is also involved in  numerous metabolic reactions that take place mainly in the liver  and detoxify harmful substances. Moreover, iron is required for  DNA synthesis. The great majority of iron used in the body is that  recycled from the continuous breakdown of red blood cells.  Figure 11.2 The Structure of Hemoglobin  Iron  |  655\n",
            "Hemoglobin is composed of four peptides. Each contains a heme  group with iron in the center.  The iron in hemoglobin binds to oxygen in the capillaries of the  lungs and transports it to cells where the oxygen is released. If iron  level is low hemoglobin is not synthesized in sufficient amounts  and the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells is reduced,  resulting in anemia. When iron levels are low in the diet the small  intestine more efficiently absorbs iron in an attempt to compensate  for the low dietary intake, but this process cannot make up for  the excessive loss of iron that occurs with chronic blood loss or  low intake. When blood cells are decommissioned for use, the body  recycles the iron back to the bone marrow where red blood cells  are made. The body stores some iron in the bone marrow, liver,  spleen, and skeletal muscle. A relatively small amount of iron is  excreted when cells lining the small intestine and skin cells die and  in blood loss, such as during menstrual bleeding. The lost iron must  be replaced from dietary sources.  The bioavailability of iron is highly dependent on dietary sources.  In animal-based foods about 60 percent of iron is bound to  hemoglobin, and heme iron is more bioavailable than nonheme iron.  The other 40 percent of iron in animal-based foods is nonheme,  which is the only iron source in plant-based foods. Some plants  contain chemicals (such as phytate, oxalates, tannins, and  polyphenols) that inhibit iron absorption. Although, eating fruits and  vegetables rich in vitamin C at the same time as iron-containing  foods markedly increases iron absorption. A review in the American  Journal of Clinical Nutrition reports that in developed countries iron  bioavailability from mixed diets ranges between 14 and 18 percent,  and that from vegetarian diets ranges between 5 and 12 percent.1  1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Iron and  Iron Deficiency.” Accessed October 2, 2011.  656  |  Iron\n",

In children,  death has occurred from ingesting as little as 200 mg of iron and  therefore it is critical to keep iron supplements out of children’s  reach.

Regardless of  the cause (be it from low dietary intake of iron or via excessive blood  loss), iron-deficiency anemia has the following signs and symptoms,  which are linked to the essential functions of iron in energy  metabolism and blood health:  • Fatigue  • Weakness  • Pale skin  • Shortness of breath  • Dizziness  • Swollen, sore tongue  660  |  Iron\n",
            "• Abnormal heart rate  Iron-deficiency anemia is diagnosed from characteristic signs and  symptoms and confirmed with simple blood tests that count red  blood cells and determine hemoglobin and iron content in blood.  Anemia is most often treated with iron supplements and increasing  the consumption of foods that are higher in iron. Iron supplements  have some adverse side effects including nausea, constipation,  diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Reducing the dose at first  and then gradually increasing to the full dose often minimizes the  side effects of iron supplements. Avoiding foods and beverages high  in phytates and also tea (which contains tannic acid and  polyphenols, both of which impair iron absorption), is important for  people who have iron-deficiency anemia. Eating a dietary source  of vitamin C at the same time as iron-containing foods improves  absorption of nonheme iron in the gut. Additionally, unknown  compounds that likely reside in muscle tissue of meat, poultry, and  fish increase iron absorption from both heme and nonheme  sources. See Table 17.2 “Enhancers and Inhibitors of Iron  Absorption” for more enhancers and inhibitors for iron absorption.

Additionally, those who have recently suffered from  traumatic blood loss, frequently donate blood, or take excessive  antacids for heartburn need more iron in the diet.  Preventing Iron-Deficiency Anemia  In young children iron-deficiency anemia can cause significant  motor, mental, and behavioral abnormalities that are long-lasting. In  the United States, the high incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in  infants and children was a major public-health problem prior to the  early 1970s, but now the incidence has been greatly reduced. This  achievement was accomplished by implementing the screening of  infants for iron-deficiency anemia in the health sector as a common  practice, advocating the fortification of infant formulas and cereals  with iron, and distributing them in supplemental food programs,  such as that within Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).  Breastfeeding, iron supplementation, and delaying the introduction  of cow’s milk for at least the first twelve months of life were also  encouraged. These practices were implemented across the  socioeconomic spectrum and by the 1980s iron-deficiency anemia  in infants had significantly declined. Other solutions had to be  introduced in young children, who no longer were fed breast milk  or fortified formulas and were consuming cow’s milk. The following  solutions were introduced to parents: provide a diet rich in sources  of iron and vitamin C, limit cow’s milk consumption to less than  twenty-four ounces per day, and a multivitamin containing iron.  In the third world, iron-deficiency anemia remains a significant  public-health challenge. The World Bank claims that a million  deaths occur every year from anemia and that the majority of those  Iron  |  663\n",
            "occur in Africa and Southeast Asia. The World Bank states five key  interventions to combat anemia:4  • Provide at-risk groups with iron supplements.  • Fortify staple foods with iron and other micronutrients whose  deficiencies are linked with anemia.  • Prevent the spread of malaria and treat the hundreds of  millions with the disease.  • Provide insecticide-treated bed netting to prevent parasitic  infections.  • Treat parasitic-worm infestations in high-risk populations.  Also, there is ongoing investigation as to whether supplying iron  cookware to at-risk populations is effective in preventing and  treating iron-deficiency anemia.

            "Zinc  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Zinc is a cofactor for over two hundred enzymes in the human body  and plays a direct role in RNA, DNA, and protein synthesis. Zinc  also is a cofactor for enzymes involved in energy metabolism. As the  result of its prominent roles in anabolic and energy metabolism, a  zinc deficiency in infants and children blunts growth. The reliance  of growth on adequate dietary zinc was discovered in the early  1960s in the Middle East where adolescent nutritional dwarfism was  linked to diets containing high amounts of phytate. Cereal grains  and some vegetables contain chemicals, one being phytate, which  blocks the absorption of zinc and other minerals in the gut. It is  estimated that half of the world’s population has a zinc-deficient  diet.1  This is largely a consequence of the lack of red meat and seafood  in the diet and reliance on cereal grains as the main dietary staple.  In adults, severe zinc deficiency can cause hair loss, diarrhea, skin  sores, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Zinc is a required cofactor  for an enzyme that synthesizes the heme portion of hemoglobin and  severely deficient zinc diets can result in anemia.  1. Prasad, Ananda. (2003).

The other important function of  selenium is as an antioxidant.  Selenium Functions and Health Benefits  Around twenty-five known proteins require selenium to function.  Some are enzymes involved in detoxifying free radicals and include  glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductase. As an integral  functioning part of these enzymes, selenium aids in the  regeneration of glutathione and oxidized vitamin C. Selenium as  part of glutathione peroxidase also protects lipids from free  radicals, and, in doing so, spares vitamin E. This is just one example  of how antioxidants work together to protect the body against free- radical induced damage. Other functions of selenium-containing  proteins include protecting endothelial cells that line tissues,  converting the inactive thyroid hormone to the active form in cells,  and mediating inflammatory and immune system responses.  Observational  studies  have  demonstrated  that  selenium  deficiency is linked to an increased risk of cancer. A review of forty- nine observational studies published in the May 2011 issue of the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews concluded that higher  selenium exposure reduces overall cancer incidence by about 34  percent in men and 10 percent in women, but notes these studies  had several limitations, including data quality, bias, and large  Selenium  |  675\n",
            "differences among different studies.1 Additionally, this review states  that there is no convincing evidence from six clinical trials that  selenium supplements reduce cancer risk.  Because of its role as a lipid protector, selenium has been  suspected to prevent cardiovascular disease. In some observational  studies, low levels of selenium are associated with a decreased risk  of cardiovascular disease. However, other studies have not always  confirmed this association and clinical trials are lacking.  Figure 11.4 Selenium’s Role in Detoxifying Free Radicals  1. Dennert G, Zwahlen M, et al. (2011).

Iodine  is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormone, which regulates  basal metabolism, growth, and development. Low iodine levels and  consequently hypothyroidism has many signs and symptoms  including fatigue, sensitivity to cold, constipation, weight gain,  depression, and dry, itchy skin and paleness. The development of  goiter may often be the most visible sign of chronic iodine  deficiency, but the consequences of low levels of thyroid hormone  can be severe during infancy, childhood, and adolescence as it  affects all stages of growth and development. Thyroid hormone  plays a major role in brain development and growth and fetuses  and infants with severe iodine deficiency develop a condition known  as cretinism, in which physical and neurological impairment can  be severe.

Currently,  the results of scientific studies evaluating the usefulness of  chromium supplementation in preventing and treating Type 2  diabetes are largely inconclusive. More research is needed to better  determine if chromium is helpful in treating certain chronic  diseases and, if so, at what doses.

It assists in tooth and bone development and maintenance. Fluoride  combats tooth decay via three mechanisms:  1. Blocking acid formation by bacteria  2. Preventing demineralization of teeth  3. Enhancing remineralization of destroyed enamel  Fluoride was first added to drinking water in 1945 in Grand Rapids,  Michigan; now over 60 percent of the US population consumes  fluoridated drinking water. The Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) has reported that fluoridation of water prevents,  on average, 27 percent of cavities in children and between 20 and 40  percent of cavities in adults.

Figure 11.7 A Severe Case of Fluorosis  Fluoride’s benefits to mineralized tissues of the teeth are well  substantiated, but the effects of fluoride on bone are not as well  known. Fluoride is currently being researched as a potential  treatment for osteoporosis. The data are inconsistent on whether  consuming fluoridated water reduces the incidence of osteoporosis  and fracture risk. Fluoride does stimulate osteoblast bone building  activity, and fluoride therapy in patients with osteoporosis has been  shown to increase BMD. In general, it appears that at low doses,  fluoride treatment increases BMD in people with osteoporosis and  is more effective in increasing bone quality when the intakes of  calcium and vitamin D are adequate. The Food and Drug  Administration has not approved fluoride for the treatment of  osteoporosis mainly because its benefits are not sufficiently known  and it has several side effects including frequent stomach upset and  joint pain. The doses of fluoride used to treat osteoporosis are much  greater than that in fluoridated water.  696  |  Fluoride\n",

            "Understanding Dietary  Reference Intakes  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) are the recommendation levels for  specific nutrients and consist of a number of different types of  recommendations. This DRI system is used in both the United States  and Canada.  Dietary Reference Intakes: A Brief  Overview  “Dietary Reference Intakes” (DRI) is an umbrella term for four  reference values:  • Estimated Average Requirements (EAR)  • Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA)  • Adequate Intakes (AI)  • Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL)  The DRIs are not minimum or maximum nutritional requirements  and are not intended to fit everybody. They are to be used as guides  only for the majority of the healthy population1.  1. Deng S, West BJ, Jensen CJ. (2010). A Quantitative  Comparison of Phytochemical Components in Global  Noni Fruits and Their Commercial Products. Food  710  |  Understanding Dietary Reference Intakes\n",
            "DRIs are important not only to help the average person determine  whether their intake of a particular nutrient is adequate, they are  also used by health-care professionals and policy makers to  determine nutritional recommendations for special groups of  people who may need help reaching nutritional goals. This includes  people who are participating in programs such as the Special  Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. The  DRI is not appropriate for people who are ill or malnourished, even  if they were healthy previously.  Determining Dietary Reference Intakes  Each DRI value is derived in a different way. See below for an  explanation of how each is determined:  1. Estimated Average Requirements. The EAR for a nutrient is  determined by a committee of nutrition experts who review  the scientific literature to determine a value that meets the  requirements of 50 percent of people in their target group  within a given life stage and for a particular sex. The  requirements of half of the group will fall below the EAR and  the other half will be above it. It is important to note that, for  each nutrient, a specific bodily function is chosen as the  criterion on which to base the EAR. For example, the EAR for  calcium is set using a criterion of maximizing bone health.  Thus, the EAR for calcium is set at a point that will meet the  needs, with respect to bone health, of half of the population.  Chemistry, 122(1), 267–70.  http:/ /www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/ S0308814610001111. Accessed December 4, 2017.  Understanding Dietary Reference Intakes  |  711\n",
            "EAR values become the scientific foundation upon which RDA  values are set.  2. Recommended Daily Allowances. Once the EAR of a nutrient  has been established, the RDA can be mathematically  determined. While the EAR is set at a point that meets the  needs of half the population, RDA values are set to meet the  needs of the vast majority (97 to 98 percent) of the target  healthy population. It is important to note that RDAs are not  the same thing as individual nutritional requirements. The  actual nutrient needs of a given individual will be different  than the RDA. However, since we know that 97 to 98 percent of  the population’s needs are met by the RDA, we can assume that  if a person is consuming the RDA of a given nutrient, they are  most likely meeting their nutritional need for that nutrient.  The important thing to remember is that the RDA is meant as a  recommendation and meeting the RDA means it is very likely  that you are meeting your actual requirement for that nutrient.  Understanding the Difference  There is a distinct difference between a requirement and a  recommendation. For instance, the DRI for vitamin D is a  recommended 600 international units each day. However, in order  to find out your true personal requirements for vitamin D, a blood  test is necessary. The blood test will provide an accurate reading  from which a medical professional can gauge your required daily  vitamin D amounts. This may be considerably more or less than the  DRI, depending on what your level actually is.  1. Adequate Intake. AIs are created for nutrients when there is  insufficient consistent scientific evidence to set an EAR for the  entire population. As with RDAs, AIs can be used as nutrient- intake goals for a given nutrient. For example, there has not  712  |  Understanding Dietary Reference Intakes\n",
            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  been sufficient scientific research into the particular  nutritional requirements for infants. Consequently, all of the  DRI values for infants are AIs derived from nutrient values in  human breast milk. For older babies and children, AI values are  derived from human milk coupled with data on adults. The AI is  meant for a healthy target group and is not meant to be  sufficient for certain at-risk groups, such as premature infants.  2. Tolerable Upper Intake Levels. The UL was established to help  distinguish healthful and harmful nutrient intakes. Developed  in part as a response to the growing usage of dietary  supplements, ULs indicate the highest level of continuous  intake of a particular nutrient that may be taken without  causing health problems. When a nutrient does not have any  known issue if taken in excessive doses, it is not assigned a UL.  However, even when a nutrient does not have a UL it is not  necessarily safe to consume in large amounts.  Figure 12.1 DRI Graph  This graph illustrates the risks of nutrient inadequacy and nutrient  excess as we move from a low intake of a nutrient to a high intake.  Starting on the left side of the graph, you can see that when you  have a very low intake of a nutrient, your risk of nutrient deficiency  is high. As your nutrient intake increases, the chances that you  will be deficient in that nutrient decrease. The point at which 50  Understanding Dietary Reference Intakes  |  713\n",
            "percent of the population meets their nutrient need is the EAR, and  the point at which 97 to 98 percent of the population meets their  needs is the RDA. The UL is the highest level at which you can  consume a nutrient without it being too much—as nutrient intake  increases beyond the UL, the risk of health problems resulting from  that nutrient increases.

Also, the values are meant to assess and plan  average intake over time; that is, you don’t need to meet  these recommendations every single day—meeting them on  average over several days is sufficient.

In the United States, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act  (NLEA) passed in 1990 and came into effect in 1994. In Canada,  mandatory labeling came into effect in 2005. As a result, all  packaged foods sold in the United States and Canada must have  nutrition labels that accurately reflect the contents of the food  products. There are several mandated nutrients and some optional  ones that manufacturers or packagers include.  In May, 2016 a new Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods,  beverages and dietary supplements was announced. This label  reflects new scientific information and will make it easier for  consumers to make informed food choices. Some of the changes  made to the label include:  • Increased type size for “Calories,” “servings per container,” and  “Serving size.”  • Bolded type for the number of calories and the “Serving size.”  • Actual amounts of vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium (in  addition to the Daily Value amounts) are required to be listed.  Vitamins A and C are now voluntary.  • Improved footnote to better explain that the Daily Value is  based on a 2,000 calories a day diet.  718  |  Discovering Nutrition Facts\n",
            "• Changed “Sugars” to “Total Sugars”. Added “Includes” to clarify  that “added sugars” is a subcomponent of “total sugars.”  • “Added sugars” in grams and percent Daily Value are required  to be listed due to scientific data the impact of added sugars  on caloric intake. Added sugars are either added during  processing of foods, or are packaged as such, and include  items such as: syrups, maltose, and invert sugar.  • “Total Fat,” “Saturated Fat,” “Trans Fat,” “Cholesterol,” “Total  Carbohydrates” are still required on the label.  • “Calories from fat” has been removed because the type of fat is  important.  • Updated values for sodium, dietary fiber, and vitamin D (which  are all required on the label) based on newer scientific  research.  • Updated serving sizes that reflect how much consumers are  more likely eating today.  • Some packages with serving sizes between one and two are  required to be labelled as one serving since most consumers  will likely eat it in one sitting  • Dual columns for certain products that are larger than a single  serving but could be consumed in one sitting will indicate “per  serving” and “per package” amounts.  • Percent DV of some nutrients were updated due to newly  available scientific data.  • The compliance date for manufacturers to adopt the new label  was extended to January 1, 2020. Manufacturers with less than  $10 million in annual food sales will have until January 1, 2021.  Reading the Label  The first part of the Nutrition Facts panel gives you information on  the serving size and how many servings are in the container. For  example, a label on a box of crackers might tell you that twenty  Discovering Nutrition Facts  |  719\n",
            "crackers equals one serving and that the whole box contains 10  servings. All other values listed thereafter, from the calories to the  dietary fiber, are based on this one serving. On the panel, the  serving size is followed by the number of calories and then a list  of selected nutrients. You will also see “Percent Daily Value” on the  far right-hand side. This helps you determine if the food is a good  source of a particular nutrient or not.  The Daily Value (DV) represents the recommended amount of  a given nutrient based on the RDA of that nutrient in a  2,000-kilocalorie diet. The DV was updated as part of the new  nutrition facts label announced in May 2016. The updated DV applies  to packaged food, beverages and dietary supplements that contain  ingredients with a DV. The percentage of Daily Value (percent DV)  represents the proportion of the total daily recommended amount  that you will get from one serving of the food. For example, in the  older food label in Figure 12.2 “Reading the Older Nutrition Label,”  the percent DV of calcium for one serving of macaroni-and-cheese  is 20 percent, which means that one serving of macaroni and cheese  provides 20 percent of the daily recommended calcium intake. Since  the DV for calcium is 1,300 milligrams, the food producer  determined the percent DV for calcium by taking the calcium  content in milligrams in each serving, and dividing it by 1,300  milligrams, and then multiplying it by 100 to get it into percentage  format. Whether you consume 2,000 calories per day or not you can  still use the percent DV as a target reference.  Generally, a percent DV of 5 is considered low and a percent  DV of 20 is considered high. This means, as a general rule, for fat,  saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium, look for foods with  a low percent DV. Alternatively, when concentrating on essential  mineral or vitamin intake, look for a high percent DV. To figure  out your fat allowance remaining for the day after consuming one  serving of macaroni-and-cheese, look at the percent DV for fat,  which is 18 percent, and subtract it from 100 percent. To know this  amount in grams of fat, read the footnote of the food label to find  that the recommended maximum amount of fat grams to consume  720  |  Discovering Nutrition Facts\n",
            "per day for a 2,000 kilocalories per day diet is 65 grams. Eighteen  percent of sixty-five equals about 12 grams. This means that 53  grams of fat are remaining in your fat allowance.

The information also allows  shoppers to compare products. Because the serving sizes are  included on the label, you can see how much of each nutrient is in  each serving to make the comparisons. Knowing how to read the  label is important because of the way some foods are presented.  For example, a bag of peanuts at the grocery store may seem like  a healthy snack to eat on the way to class. But have a look at that  label. Does it contain one serving, or multiple servings?

A health claim  is a statement that links a particular food with a reduced risk of  developing disease.  Implied health claims include the use of  symbols, statements and other forms of communication that  suggest a relationship between a food  substance and disease  reduction. As such, health claims such as “Three grams of soluble  fiber from oatmeal daily in combination with a diet low in  cholesterol and saturated fat may reduce the risk of heart disease,”  must be evaluated by the FDA before it may appear on packaging.  Prior to the passage of the NLEA products that made such claims  were categorized as drugs and not food. All health claims must be  substantiated by scientific evidence in order for it to be approved  and put on a food label. To avoid having companies making false  claims, laws also regulate how health claims are presented on food  packaging. In addition to the claim being backed up by scientific  evidence, it may never claim to diagnose, mitigate, cure or treat  the disease.

(More information on these allergens will be discussed in  Chapter 18 “Nutritional Issues”.) The FDA does not require warnings  that cross contamination may occur during packaging, however  most manufacturers include this advisory as a courtesy.

Vary your choices to get the  benefit of as many different vegetables and fruits as you can. You  may choose to drink fruit juice as a replacement for eating fruit. (As  long as the juice is 100 percent fruit juice and only half your fruit  intake is replaced with juice, this is an acceptable exchange.) For  snacks, eat fruits, vegetables, or unsalted nuts.  Fill a quarter of your plate with whole grains such as 100 percent  whole-grain cereals, breads, crackers, rice, and pasta. Half of your  daily grain intake should be whole grains. Read the ingredients list  on food labels carefully to determine if a food is comprised of whole  grains.  Select a variety of protein foods to improve nutrient intake and  promote health benefits. Each week, be sure to include a nice array  of protein sources in your diet, such as nuts, seeds, beans, legumes,  poultry, soy, and seafood. The recommended consumption amount  for seafood for adults is two 4-ounce servings per week. When  choosing meat, select lean cuts. Be conscious to prepare meats  using little or no added saturated fat, such as butter.  If you enjoy drinking milk or eating milk products, such as cheese  and yogurt, choose low-fat or nonfat products. Low-fat and nonfat  products contain the same amount of calcium and other essential  nutrients as whole-milk products, but with much less fat and  calories. Calcium, an important mineral for your body, is also  available in lactose-free and fortified soy beverage and rice  beverage products. You can also get calcium in vegetables and other  fortified foods and beverages.

Starting with these small shifts in your diet as mentioned above will  boost your overall health profile.  Discretionary Calories  When following a balanced, healthful diet with many nutrient-dense  foods, you may consume enough of your daily nutrients before  you reach your daily calorie limit. The remaining calories are  discretionary (to be used according to your best judgment). To find  out your discretionary calorie allowance, add up all the calories  you consumed to achieve the recommended nutrient intakes and  then subtract this number from your recommended daily caloric  allowance.

Antioxidant Variety in Food Provides  Health Benefits  Not only has the several-billion-dollar supplement industry  inundated us with FDA-unapproved health claims, but science is  continuously advancing and providing us with a multitude of  promising health benefits from particular fruits, vegetables, teas,  herbs, and spices. For instance, blueberries protect against  cardiovascular disease, an apple or pear a day reduces stroke risk by  over 52 percent, eating more carrots significantly reduces the risk of  bladder cancer, drinking tea reduces cholesterol and helps glucose  homeostasis, and cinnamon blocks infection and reduces the risk of  some cancers. However, recall that science also tells us that no one  nutrient alone is shown to provide these effects.  What micronutrient and phytochemical sources are best at  protecting against chronic disease? All of them, together. Just as  there is no wonder supplement or drug, there is no superior fruit,  vegetable, spice, herb, or tea that protects against all diseases. A  review in the July–August 2010 issue of Oxidative Medicine and  Cellular Longevity concludes that the plant-food benefits to health  are  attributed  to  two  main  factors—that  nutrients  and  phytochemicals are present at low concentrations in general, and  that the complex mixtures of nutrients and phytochemicals  provides additive and synergistic effects4. In short, don’t overdo it  4. Bouayed, J. and T. Bohn. (2010). Exogenous  Antioxidants—Double-Edged Swords in Cellular Redox  MyPlate Planner  |  753\n",

Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables rich in antioxidants and  phytochemicals promotes health. Consider these diets:  Mediterranean diet. Fresh fruit and vegetables are abundant in this  diet, and the cultural identity of the diet involves multiple herbs  and spices. Moreover, olive oil is the main source of fat. Fish and  poultry are consumed in low amounts and red meat is consumed  in very low amounts. An analysis of twelve studies involving over  one million subjects published in the September 2008 issue of the  British Medical Journal reports that people who followed the  Mediterranean diet had a 9 percent decrease in overall deaths, a 9  percent decrease in cardiovascular death, a 6 percent decrease in  cancer deaths, and a 13 percent reduced incidence of Parkinson’s  disease and Alzheimer’s disease5. The authors of this study  concluded that the Mediterranean diet is useful as a primary  prevention against some major chronic diseases.  Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH diet).

According to this  study, the largest single contributor to fruit intake was orange juice,  and potatoes were the dominant vegetable.  The USDA recommends that you fill half your plate with fruits  and vegetables. The number of servings of fruits and vegetables  that a person should consume every day is dependent on age, sex,  and level of physical activity. For example, a forty-year-old male  who exercises for sixty minutes per day should consume 2 cups of  fruit and 3½ cups of vegetables, while a fifteen-year-old female who  exercises for thirty minutes per day should consume 1½ cups of fruit  and 2½ cups of vegetables. (One cup of a fruit or vegetable is equal  to one banana, one small apple, twelve baby carrots, one orange,  or one large sweet potato.)

The recommended dietary allowances  (RDA) were first established out of concern that America’s overseas  World War II troops were not consuming enough daily nutrients  to maintain good health. The first Food and Nutrition Board was  created in 1941, and in the same year set recommendations for the  adequate intakes of caloric energy and eight essential nutrients.  These were disseminated to officials responsible for food relief for  armed forces and civilians supporting the war effort. Since 1980,  the dietary guidelines have been reevaluated and updated every  five years by the advisory committees of the US Department of  Agriculture (USDA) and the US Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS). The guidelines are continually revised to keep up  with new scientific evidence-based conclusions on the importance  of nutritional adequacy and physical activity to overall health.  While dietary recommendations set prior to 1980 focused only on  preventing nutrient inadequacy, the current dietary guidelines have  the additional goals of promoting health, reducing chronic disease,  and decreasing the prevalence of overweight and obesity.

This is a vast  and never-ending task, given the large number of essential human  nutrients. These nutrients include protein, energy, carbohydrates,  fats and lipids, a range of vitamins, and a host of minerals and trace  elements.  Many countries rely on WHO and FAO to establish and  disseminate this information, which they adopt as part of their  national dietary allowances. Others use it as a base for their  standards. The establishment of human nutrient requirements is the  common foundation for all countries to develop food-based dietary  guidelines for their populations.  Establishing requirements means that the public health and  clinical significance of intake levels – both deficiency and excess  – and associated disease patterns for each nutrient, need to be  thoroughly reviewed for all age groups. Every ten to fifteen years,  enough research is completed and new evidence accumulated to  warrant WHO and FAO undertaking a revision of at least the major  nutrient requirements and recommended intakes.  http:/ /www.who.int/nutrition/topics/nutrecomm/en/  Why Are Guidelines Needed?

It begins with the first trimester (weeks one to  week twelve), extends into the second trimester (weeks thirteen  to week twenty-seven), and ends with the third trimester (week  twenty-eight to birth). At conception, a sperm cell fertilizes an egg  cell, creating a zygote. The zygote rapidly divides into multiple cells  to become an embryo and implants itself in the uterine wall, where,  by the end of the 8th week after conception, it develops into a  fetus. Some of the major changes that occur include the branching  of nerve cells to form primitive neural pathways at eight weeks. At  the twenty-week mark, physicians typically perform an ultrasound  to acquire information about the fetus and check for abnormalities.  By this time, it is possible to know the sex of the baby. At twenty- eight weeks, the unborn baby begins to add body fat in preparation  for life outside of the womb.2 Journey Across the LifeSpan: Human  Development and Health Promotion. Philadelphia: F.A.

If these  nutritional needs are not met, infants could suffer from low birth  weight (a birth weight less than 5.5 pounds, which is 2,500 grams),  among other developmental problems. Therefore, it is crucial to  make careful dietary choices.  The Early Days of Pregnancy  For medical purposes, pregnancy is measured from the first day of  a woman’s last menstrual period until childbirth, and typically lasts  about forty weeks. Major changes begin to occur in the earliest  days, often weeks before a woman even knows that she is pregnant.  During this period, adequate nutrition supports cell division, tissue  differentiation, and organ development. As each week passes, new  milestones are reached. Therefore, women who are trying to  conceive should make proper dietary choices to ensure the delivery  of a healthy baby. Fathers-to-be should also consider their eating  habits. A sedentary lifestyle and a diet low in fresh fruits and  vegetables may affect male fertility. Men who drink too much  alcohol may also damage the quantity and quality of their sperm.1.  For both men and women, adopting healthy habits also boosts  general well-being and makes it possible to meet the demands of  parenting.  1. Healthy Sperm: Improving Your Fertility.

Therefore, it is important  for all women of  childbearing age to get  400 micrograms of folate  per day prior to  pregnancy and 600  micrograms per day  during pregnancy. Folate,  which is also known as  folic acid, is crucial for the production of DNA and RNA  and the formation of cells. A deficiency can cause  megaloblastic anemia, or the development of abnormal  red blood cells, in pregnant women. It can also have a  profound effect on the unborn baby. Typically, folate  intake has the greatest impact during the first eight  weeks of pregnancy, when the neural tube closes. The  neural tube develops into the fetus’s brain and spinal  cord, and adequate folate reduces the risk of brain  abnormalities and neural tube defects, which occur in  one in a thousand pregnancies in North America each  year. This vital nutrient also supports the spinal cord  and its protective coverings. Inadequate folic acid can  result in birth defects, such as spina bifida, which is the  failure of the spinal column to close. The name “folate”  is derived from the Latin word folium for leaf, and leafy  green vegetables such as spinach and kale are excellent  sources of it. Folate is also found in legumes, liver, and  Pregnancy  |  787\n",

Additionally, since 1998, food manufacturers  have been required to add folate to cereals and other  grain products.2  Weight Gain during Pregnancy  During pregnancy, a mother’s body changes in many ways. One  of the most notable and significant changes is weight gain. If a  pregnant woman does not gain enough weight, her unborn baby  will be at risk. Poor weight gain, especially in the second and third  trimesters, could result not only in low birth weight, but also infant  mortality and intellectual disabilities. Therefore, it is vital for a  pregnant woman to maintain a healthy amount of weight gain. Her  weight prior to pregnancy also has a major effect. Infant birth  weight is one of the best indicators of a baby’s future health.  Pregnant women of normal prepregnancy weight should gain  between 25 and 35 pounds in total through the entire pregnancy.  The precise amount that a mother should gain usually depends on  her beginning weight or body mass index (BMI). See Table 13.1 “Body  Mass Index and Pregnancy” for The Institute of Medicine (IOM)  recommendations.  2. Folic Acid.

Above 30.0  Obese (all classes) 11–20 lbs.  Starting weight below or above the normal range can lead to  different complications. Pregnant women with a prepregnancy BMI  below twenty are at a higher risk of a preterm delivery and an  underweight infant. Pregnant women with a prepregnancy BMI  above thirty have an increased risk for a cesarean section during  delivery. Therefore, it is optimal to have a BMI in the normal range  prior to pregnancy.  Generally, women gain 2 to 5 pounds in the first trimester. After  that, it is best not to gain more than one pound per week. Some of  the new weight is due to the growth of the fetus, while some is due  to changes in the mother’s body that support the pregnancy. Weight  gain often breaks down in the following manner as shown in Figure  13.2 6 to 8 pounds of fetus, 1 to 2 pounds for the placenta (which  supplies nutrients to the fetus and removes waste products), 2 to  3 pounds for the amniotic sac (which contains fluids that surround  and cushion the fetus), 1 to 2 pounds in the breasts, 1 to 2 pounds in  the uterus, 3 to 4 pounds of maternal blood, 3 to 4 pounds maternal  fluids, and 8 to 10 pounds of extra maternal fat stores that will be  needed for breastfeeding and delivery.

            "The pace of weight gain is also important. If a woman puts on  weight too slowly, her physician may recommend nutritional  counseling. If she gains weight too quickly, especially in the third  trimester, it may be the result of edema, or swelling due to excess  fluid accumulation. Rapid weight gain may also result from  increased calorie consumption or a lack of exercise.  Weight Loss after Pregnancy  During labor, new mothers lose some of the weight they gained  during pregnancy with the delivery of their child. In the following  weeks, they continue to shed weight as they lose accumulated fluids  and their blood volume returns to normal. Some studies have  hypothesized that breastfeeding also helps a new mother lose some  of the extra weight, although research is ongoing.5.  New mothers who gain a healthy amount of weight and  participate in regular physical activity during their pregnancies also  have an easier time shedding weight post-pregnancy. However,  women who gain more weight than needed for a pregnancy typically  retain that excess weight as body fat.

            "Nutritional Requirements  As a mother’s body changes, so do her nutritional needs. Pregnant  women must consume more calories and nutrients in the second  and third trimesters than other adult women. However, the average  recommended daily caloric intake can vary depending on activity  level and the mother’s normal weight. Also, pregnant women should  choose a high-quality, diverse diet, consume fresh foods, and  prepare nutrient-rich meals. Steaming is one of the best ways to  cook vegetables. Vitamins are destroyed by overcooking, whereas  uncooked vegetables and fruits have the highest vitamin content.  It is also recommended for pregnant women to take prenatal  supplements  to  ensure  adequate  intake  of  the  needed  micronutrients.  Energy and Macronutrients  During the first trimester, a pregnant woman has the same energy  requirements as normal and should consume the same number of  calories as usual. However, as the pregnancy progresses, a woman  must increase her caloric intake. According to the IOM, she should  consume an additional 340 calories per day during the second  trimester, and an additional 450 calories per day during the third  trimester. This is partly due to an increase in metabolism, which  occurs during pregnancy and contributes to increased energy  needs. A woman can easily meet these increased needs by  consuming more nutrient-dense foods.  The recommended daily allowance, or RDA, of carbohydrates  during pregnancy is about 175 to 265 grams per day to fuel fetal  brain development. The best food sources for pregnant women  include whole-grain breads and cereals, brown rice, root vegetables,  legumes, and fruits. These and other unrefined carbohydrates  792  |  Pregnancy\n",
            "provide nutrients, phytochemicals, antioxidants, and the extra 3  mg/day of fiber that is recommended during pregnancy. These  foods also help to build the placenta and supply energy for the  growth of the unborn baby.  During pregnancy, extra protein is needed for the synthesis of  new maternal and fetal tissues. Protein builds muscle and other  tissues, enzymes, antibodies, and hormones in both the mother and  the unborn baby. Additional protein also supports increased blood  volume and the production of amniotic fluid. The RDA of protein  during pregnancy is 71 grams per day, which is 25 grams above the  normal recommendation. Protein should be derived from healthy  sources, such as lean red meat, poultry, legumes, nuts, seeds, eggs,  and fish. Low-fat milk and other dairy products also provide protein,  along with calcium and other nutrients.  There are no specific recommendations for fats in pregnancy,  apart from following normal dietary guidelines. Although this is  the case, it is recommended to increase the amount of essential  fatty acids linoleic acid and ∝-linolenic acid because they are  incorporated into the placenta and fetal tissues.  Fats should make  up 25 to 35 percent of daily calories, and those calories should  come from healthy fats, such as avocados and salmon. It is not  recommended for pregnant women to be on a very low-fat diet,  since it would be hard to meet the needs of essential fatty acids and  fat-soluble vitamins. Fatty acids are important during pregnancy  because they support the baby’s brain and eye development.  Fluids  Fluid intake must also be monitored. According to the IOM,  pregnant women should drink 2.3 liters (about 10 cups) of liquids  per day to provide enough fluid for blood production. It is also  important to drink liquids during and after physical activity or when  it is hot and humid outside, to replace fluids lost to perspiration.  Pregnancy  |  793\n",

Although the levels  Pregnancy  |  795\n",
            "are the same as those for nonpregnant women, many women do  not typically consume adequate amounts and should make an extra  effort to meet those needs. Many of these nutrient requirements are  higher yet for pregnant mothers who are in their teen years due to  higher needs for their own growth in addition to the growth of the  fetus.  There is an increased need for all B vitamins during pregnancy.  Adequate vitamin B6 supports the metabolism of amino acids, while  more vitamin B12 is needed for the synthesis of red blood cells and  DNA. Also remember that folate needs increase during pregnancy  to 600 micrograms per day to prevent neural tube defects. This  micronutrient is crucial for fetal development because it also helps  produce the extra blood a woman’s body requires during pregnancy.  Additional zinc is crucial for cell development and protein  synthesis. The need for vitamin A also increases, and extra iron  intake is important because of the increase in blood supply during  pregnancy and to support the fetus and placenta. Iron is the one  micronutrient that is almost impossible to obtain in adequate  amounts from food sources only. Therefore, even if a pregnant  woman consumes a healthy diet, there still is a need to take an iron  supplement, in the form of ferrous salts.  For most other minerals, recommended intakes are similar to  those for nonpregnant women, although it is crucial for pregnant  women to make sure to meet the RDAs to reduce the risk of birth  defects. In addition, pregnant mothers should avoid exceeding the  Upper Limit recommendations. Taking megadose supplements can  lead to excessive amounts of certain micronutrients, such as  vitamin A and zinc, which may produce toxic effects that can also  result in birth defects.

So, nutrient-dense  foods, which are higher in proportion of macronutrients and  micronutrients relative to calories, are essential to a healthy diet.  Examples of nutrient-dense foods include fruits, vegetables, whole  grains, peas, beans, eggs, reduced-fat dairy, and lean meats.  Pregnant women should be able to meet almost all of their increased  needs via a healthy diet. However, expectant mothers should take a  prenatal supplement to ensure an adequate intake of iron and folate.  Here are some additional dietary guidelines for pregnant women.6:  • Eat iron-rich or iron-fortified foods, including meat or meat  alternatives, breads, and cereals, to help satisfy increased need  for iron and prevent iron-deficiency anemia.  • Include vitamin C-rich foods, such as orange juice, broccoli, or  strawberries, to enhance iron absorption.  • Eat a well-balanced diet, including fruits, vegetables, whole  grains, calcium-rich foods, lean meats, and a variety of cooked  seafood (excluding fish that are high in mercury, such as  swordfish and shark).  • Drink additional fluids, water especially.  6. Staying Healthy and Safe.

Therefore, it is  vital for women to avoid them throughout a pregnancy. Some are so  detrimental that a woman should avoid them even if she suspects  that she might be pregnant. For example, consumption of alcoholic  beverages results in a range of abnormalities that fall under the  umbrella of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. They include learning  and attention deficits, heart defects, and abnormal facial features  (See Figure 13.3). Alcohol enters the unborn baby via the umbilical  cord and can slow fetal growth, damage the brain, or even result  in miscarriage. The effects of alcohol are most severe in the first  trimester, when the organs are developing. There is no safe amount  of alcohol that a pregnant woman can consume. Although pregnant  women in the past may have participated in behavior that was not  known to be risky at the time, such as drinking alcohol or smoking  cigarettes, today we know that it is best to avoid those substances  completely to protect the health of the unborn baby.

The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology  released a report, which found that women who consume 200  milligrams or more of caffeine a day (which is the amount in 10  ounces of coffee or 25 ounces of tea) increase the risk of  miscarriage7.  Consuming large quantities of caffeine affects the pregnant  mother as well, leading to irritability, anxiety, and insomnia. Most  experts agree that small amounts of caffeine each day are safe  (about one 8-ounce cup of coffee a day or less)8. However, that  amount should not be exceeded.  Foodborne Illness  For both mother and child, foodborne illness can cause major health  problems. For example, the foodborne illness caused by the bacteria  Listeria monocytogenes can cause spontaneous abortion and fetal  or newborn meningitis. According to the CDC, pregnant women  are twenty times more likely to become infected with this disease,  which is known as listeriosis, than nonpregnant, healthy adults.  Symptoms include headaches, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, and  7. Weng X, Odouli R, Li DK. (2008).

Foods more likely to contain the bacteria that should be avoided  are unpasteurized dairy products, especially soft cheeses, and also  smoked seafood, hot dogs, paté, cold cuts, and uncooked meats. To  avoid consuming contaminated foods, women who are pregnant or  breastfeeding should take the following measures:  • Thoroughly rinse fruits and vegetables before eating them  • Keep cooked and ready-to-eat food separate from raw meat,  poultry, and seafood  • Store food at 40° F (4° C) or below in the refrigerator and at 0°  F (−18° C) in the freezer  • Refrigerate perishables, prepared food, or leftovers within two  hours of preparation or eating  • Clean the refrigerator regularly and wipe up any spills right  away  • Check the expiration dates of stored food once per week  • Cook hot dogs, cold cuts (e.g., deli meats/luncheon meat), and  smoked seafood to 160° F before consuming  It is always important to avoid consuming contaminated food to  prevent food poisoning. This is especially true during pregnancy.  Heavy metal contaminants, particularly mercury, lead, and  cadmium, pose risks to pregnant mothers.

Expectant mothers are able to eat cooked shellfish  such as shrimp, farm-raised fish such as salmon, and a maximum  of 6 ounces of albacore (white) tuna. Canned light tuna is preferred  over canned white albacore tuna because it has lower mercury  levels.  It is very important for pregnant women to avoid fish with  very high methylmercury levels, such as shark, swordfish, tilefish,  and king mackerel.

In addition,  women who exercise during pregnancy report fewer discomforts  and may have an easier time losing excess weight after childbirth.  Brisk walking, swimming, or an aerobics class geared toward  expectant mothers are all great ways to get exercise during a  pregnancy. Healthy women who already participate in vigorous  activities before pregnancy, such as running, can continue doing so  during pregnancy provided they discuss an exercise plan with their  physicians.  However, pregnant women should avoid pastimes that could  cause injury, such as soccer, football, and other contact sports,  or activities that could lead to falls, such as horseback riding and  downhill skiing. It may be best for pregnant women not to  participate in certain sports, such as tennis, that require you to  jump or change direction quickly. Scuba diving should also be  avoided because it might result in the fetus developing  decompression sickness. This potentially fatal condition results  from a rapid decrease in pressure when a diver ascends too  quickly11.  Food Cravings and Aversions  Food aversions and cravings do not have a major impact unless food  choices are extremely limited. The most common food aversions  are milk, meats, pork, and liver. For most women, it is not harmful  11. Reid, R. L., & Lorenzo, M. (2018). SCUBA Diving in  Pregnancy.

However, a medical disorder known as pica occurs  during pregnancy more often than in nonpregnant women. Pica is  willingly consuming foods with little or no nutritive value, such as  dirt, clay, laundry starch, and large quantities of ice or freezer frost.  In some places this is a culturally accepted practice. However, it can  be harmful if these substances take the place of nutritious foods or  contain toxins. Pica is associated with iron deficiency, sometimes  even in the absence of anemia, and iron tends to cure the pica  behavior.  Complications during Pregnancy  Expectant mothers may face different complications during the  course of their pregnancy. They include certain medical conditions  that could greatly impact a pregnancy if left untreated, such as  gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes, which have diet  and nutrition implications.  Gestational hypertension is a condition of high blood pressure  during the second half of pregnancy.  First-time mothers are at a greater risk, along with women who  have mothers or sisters who had gestational hypertension, women  carrying multiple fetuses, women with a prior history of high blood  pressure or kidney disease, and women who are overweight or  who have obesity when they become pregnant. Hypertension can  prevent the placenta from getting enough blood, which would result  in the baby getting less oxygen and nutrients. This can result in low  birth weight, although most women with gestational hypertension  can still deliver a healthy baby if the condition is detected and  treated early.  Some risk factors can be controlled, such as diet, while others  cannot, such as family history. If left untreated, gestational  hypertension can lead to a serious complication called preeclampsia  Pregnancy  |  803\n",
            "and eclampsia, which is sometimes referred to as toxemia of  pregnancy. This disorder is marked by elevated blood pressure and  protein in the urine and is associated with swelling. To prevent  preeclampsia, the WHO recommends increasing calcium intake for  women consuming diets low in that micronutrient, administering  a low dosage of aspirin (75 milligrams), and increasing prenatal  checkups. The WHO does not recommend the restriction of dietary  salt intake during pregnancy with the aim of preventing the  development of pre-eclampsia and its complications12.  About 4 percent of pregnant women suffer from a condition  known as gestational diabetes, which is abnormal glucose tolerance  during pregnancy. The body becomes resistant to the hormone  insulin, which enables cells to transport glucose from the blood.  Gestational diabetes is usually diagnosed around twenty-four to  twenty-six weeks, although it is possible for the condition to  develop later into a pregnancy. Signs and symptoms of this disease  include extreme hunger, thirst, or fatigue. If blood sugar levels are  not properly monitored and treated, the baby might gain too much  weight and require a cesarean delivery. Diet and regular physical  activity can help to manage this condition.

Most expectant mothers begin thinking about how they will feed  their baby early in their pregnancy. Therefore, it is important to  offer breastfeeding education and support starting with the first  prenatal appointment.  Support from family members, especially the  baby’s father and grandmother, plus friends, employers, and others  can greatly help with both the decision-making process during  pregnancy and the beginning and maintenance of breastfeeding  after the baby’s birth. In the United States, about 83.2 percent of  babies start out being breastfed.1 Yet by the age of six months, when  solid foods should begin to be introduced into a child’s diet along  with breast milk, only about 25 percent of infants in the United  States were still breastfed exclusively, according to the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).2  The approval and assistance of family members, friends,  employers, health-care providers, and policymakers can make an  enormous difference and provide the needed promotion and  support for mothers who wish to breastfeed their children.  Education about breastfeeding typically begins with health-care  providers. During prenatal care and often soon after a woman has  given birth, doctors, nurses, and other clinicians can explain the  benefits of breastfeeding and describe the proper technique. Nearly  all births in the United States and Canada occur in hospital settings,  and hospital practices in labor, delivery, postpartum care, and  discharge planning can inform and support women who want to  1. U.S. Centers for Disease Control.

Employed mothers have been  less likely to initiate breastfeeding and tend to breastfeed for a  shorter period of time than new mothers who are not employed or  who have lengthy maternity leaves. In 2010 in the United States, the  passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) required most employers  to provide accommodations within the workplace for new mothers  to pump breast milk. This law requires a private and clean space  within the workplace, other than a restroom, along with adequate  break time for a woman to express milk.5It also requires health  insurance to cover certain breastfeeding services and supplies such  as a breast pump.  Additionally, the Hawai‘i State Legislature has passed several bills  to support breastfeeding. These bills provide a number of rights  to breastfeeding women in Hawai‘i. These include: the right to  breastfeed in public, the right to pump breastmilk at work  (extending beyond the ACA worksite protections), protection from  an employer from firing or penalizing a lactating employee because  the employee breastfeeds or expresses milk at the workplace,6 and  the right for breastfeeding mothers to decline jury duty until the  5. US Department of Health and Human Services.

The  trunk of the body grows faster than the arms and legs, while the  head becomes less prominent in comparison to the limbs. Organs  and organ systems grow at a rapid rate. Also during this period,  countless synapse pathways to link brain neurons are reinforced  while others are trimmed back in the brain.

Developmental milestones include  sitting up without support, learning to walk, teething, and vocalizing  among many, many others. All of these changes require adequate  nutrition to ensure development at the appropriate rate.8  Healthy infants grow steadily, but not always at an even pace. For  example, during the first year of life, height increases by 50 percent,  while weight triples. Physicians and other health professionals use  growth charts to track a baby’s development process. Because  infants cannot stand, length is used instead of height to determine  the rate of a child’s growth. Other important developmental  measurements include head circumference and weight. All of these  must be tracked and compared against standard measurements for  an infant’s age.  In the US, for infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months of  age, the WHO growth charts are used to monitor growth. These  standards represent optimal growth for children at this age and  allow for tracking growth trends over time through percentile  rankings. Growth charts may provide warnings that a child has a  medical problem or is malnourished. Growth that is too rapid can  increase the risk for overweight and obesity in childhood and later  in life. Insufficient weight or height gain during infancy may indicate  a condition known as failure-to-thrive (FTT), which is characterized  by poor growth. FTT can happen at any age, but in infancy, it  typically occurs after six months. Some causes include poverty, lack  of enough food, feeding inappropriate foods, and excessive intake of  fruit juice.  Figure 13.4 WHO Growth Chart For Boys From Birth To 24 Months  8. McMillan B.

A newborn infant (birth to 28 days) requires feedings eight to  twelve times a day or more. Between 1 and 3 months of age, the  breastfed infant becomes more efficient, and the number of  feedings per day often become fewer even though the amount of  milk consumed stays the same. After about six months, infants can  gradually begin to consume solid foods to help meet nutrient needs.  Foods that are added in addition to breastmilk are called  complementary foods. Complementary foods should be nutrient  dense to provide optimal nutrition. Complementary foods include  baby meats, vegetables, fruits, infant cereal, and dairy products such  as yogurt, but not infant formula. Infant formula is a substitute, not  a complement to breastmilk. In addition to complementary foods,  the World Health Organization recommends that breastfeeding  continue up to 2 years of age or beyond, and the American Academy  of Pediatrics recommends at least one year of breastfeeding, or  longer. 9  Energy and Macronutrients  Energy needs relative to size are much greater in an infant than an  adult.

For infants  ages six to twelve months, the estimated requirement is 645 to 844  kilocalories per day for boys and 593 to 768 kilocalories per day for  girls. From the age one to age two, the estimated requirement rises  to 844–1,050 kilocalories per day for boys and 768–997 kilocalories  per day for girls.10 How often an infant wants to eat will also change  over time due to growth spurts, which typically occur at about two  weeks and six weeks of age, and again at about three months and six  months of age.  The dietary recommendations for infants are based on the  nutritional content of human breast milk. Carbohydrates make up  about 40 to 55percent of the caloric content in breast milk, which  amounts to a RDA (AI) of about 60 grams for infants 0-6 months  old, and 95 grams for infants 7-12 months old. Almost all of the  carbohydrate in human milk is lactose, which infants digest and  tolerate well. In fact, lactose intolerance is practically nonexistent  in infants.

A high-fat diet  that includes cholesterol is necessary to support the development  of neural pathways in the brain and throughout the body. However,  saturated fats and trans fatty acids inhibit this growth. Infants who  are over the age of six months, which means they are receiving  complementary foods, should not consume foods that are high in  these types of fats. The RDA (AI) for total fat is 30 grams per day for  infants 0-6 months old and 31 grams per day for infants 7-12 months  old.  Micronutrients  Almost all of the nutrients that infants require during the first 6  months can be met if they consume an adequate amount of breast  milk. There are a few exceptions, though. Unless the mother is  taking a large dose of Vitamin D, human milk will be low in vitamin  D, which is needed for calcium absorption and building bone, among  other things. Therefore, breastfed children often need to take a  vitamin D supplement in the form of drops. Infants at the highest  risk for vitamin D deficiency are those with darker skin and little  to no exposure to sunlight, and infants born prematurely. Breast  milk is also low in vitamin K11Pediatric clinics of North America, 60(1),  49–74., which is required for blood clotting, and deficits could lead  to bleeding or hemorrhagic disease. Babies are born with limited  vitamin K, so supplementation may be needed initially and some  states require a vitamin K injection after birth. Also, breast milk is  not high in iron, but the iron in breast milk is well absorbed by  infants. After five to eight months, however, an infant needs an  additional source of iron other than breast milk. For exclusively  11. Ballard, O., & Morrow, A. L. (2013).

            "Breastfeeding  Although few aspects of human nutrition are surrounded by as  much public controversy as is the choice to breastfeed or formula  feed an infant, a little knowledge about the science of breastfeeding  can go a long way to settling this debate. This section will cover  the science of lactation and practical ways to improve both the  breastfeeding experience and the nutritional status of mothers and  infants. Learning about the different parts of the breast and their  function is a first step to becoming better able to support mothers  who want to breastfeed.    The structure of the breast includes the alveoli which are grape- like clusters where milk is made. A network of ducts branch out  and carry the milk from the alveoli to the nipple. A tiny muscle  surrounds each of the alveoli; when a baby nurses at the breast,  a hormone is released from the mother’s brain that makes these  muscles contract and push the milk out into the ducts and towards  820  |  Infancy\n",
            "the nipple. Groups of alveoli connected by ducts are organized into  lobes, or sections, of the breast. The breast contains 15 to 25 lobes,  and each lobe contains 10 to 100 alveoli.  The areola is the darker skin around the nipple and is a visual  target that helps the baby find the breast. The bumps on the areola  are glands that provide lubrication and protection to the tissue.  These glands also produce a scent to help the baby find the nipple.  The nipple and areola contain erectile smooth muscles that contract  to make the nipple protrude more during breastfeeding. Nipples  come in many sizes and shapes and contain from 4 to 18 openings  for the milk to flow out. Mothers do not need to do anything to get  their nipples ready to breastfeed.  Breast size is mainly determined by the amount of fat in the  breast; the milk-making structures don’t vary as much as the  amount of fat tissue. Most mothers can make enough milk for their  babies whether they have small or large breasts. It is normal for a  woman to have one breast that is different than the other in size  or shape. During pregnancy, the breasts will normally increase in  size. If a woman does not notice any changes to her breast during  pregnancy, she should discuss this with her healthcare provider or  a lactation consultant.  After the birth of the baby, nutritional needs must be met to  ensure that an infant not only survives, but thrives from infancy  into childhood. Breastfeeding provides the fuel a newborn needs for  rapid growth and development. As a result, the WHO recommends  that breastfeeding is exclusive (no other food or drink) for the first  six months of an infant’s life. Exclusive breastfeeding is one of the  best ways a mother can support the growth and protect the health  of her infant child. Breast milk contains nearly all of the nutrients  that a newborn requires and gives a child the best start to a healthy  life. Most women want to breastfeed their babies; in the US, over  80% of women start to breastfeed their infants. Unfortunately, a  mother’s intention alone may not be enough to make this practice  Infancy  |  821\n",
            "successful. Around the world, approximately 40 percent of infants  are breastfed exclusively for the recommended 6 months.121314  New mothers must also pay careful consideration to their own  nutritional requirements to help their bodies recover in the wake of  the pregnancy. This is particularly true for women who breastfeed  their babies, which increases the need in certain nutrients.  Lactation  Preparation for making breast milk, although begun in puberty, is  not completed until a woman’s first pregnancy. Early in the first  trimester, the cells that will secrete milk divide and multiply.  Hormones play a major role in preparing the woman’s body to  breastfeed, particularly during the second and third trimesters. At  that point, levels of the hormone prolactin increase to stimulate the  growth of the milk duct system, which initiates and maintains milk  production. Also during pregnancy, progesterone stimulates growth  of the alveoli, the clusters of cells where the milk is made. During  this process ducts that will carry the milk grow larger and branch  out, and new capillaries are also formed to circulate the increased  blood supply. However, levels of the hormone progesterone need  to decrease for successful milk production, because progesterone  12. UNICEF Data. (2019, October).

Shortly after birth, the expulsion of the  placenta triggers progesterone levels to fall, which activates  lactation.15 When the infant suckles at the breast, levels of the  hormone oxytocin rise to promote the release of breast milk from  the breast when the infant suckles, which is known as the milk- ejection reflex.  New mothers usually find that their appetite and thirst is greater  than before pregnancy; it is recommended that they still focus on  nutrient-dense foods to nourish their body and replace their body’s  nutrient stores. A conservative rate of weight loss (1-2 pounds per  week) during lactation does not usually impact the quantity or  quality of breast milk, but maternal deficiencies in some nutrients  have been described during lactation. The nutrient content of  breastmilk does not change much based upon maternal diet for  most nutrients. The RDA for energy is 330 additional Calories during  the first six months of lactation and 400 additional Calories during  the second six months of lactation. The energy needed to support  breastfeeding comes from both increased intake and from stored  fat. For example, during the first six months after her baby is born,  the daily caloric cost for a lactating mother is 500 Calories, with  330 calories derived from increased intake and 170 Calories derived  from maternal fat stores. This helps explain why breastfeeding may  promote weight loss in new mothers. Lactating women should also  drink 3.1 liters of liquids per day (about 13 cups) to avoid  dehydration, according to the IOM. As is the case during pregnancy,  the RDA of most vitamins and minerals increases for women who  are breastfeeding their babies. Most doctors and nutritionists  recommend that lactating women continue taking their prenatal  vitamin/mineral supplement during lactation.  The following table  15. King J.

            "Components of Breastmilk  Human breast milk not only provides adequate nutrition for infants,  it also helps to protect newborns from disease. In addition, breast  milk is rich in cholesterol, which is needed for brain development. It  is helpful to know the different types and components of breastmilk,  along with the nutrients they provide to enable an infant to survive  and thrive.  Colostrum is the milk produced immediately after birth, prior  to the start of mature milk production, and lasts for two to five  days after the arrival of the baby. Cells in the breast can begin to  secrete colostrum by mid-pregnancy. During the last trimester, the  alveoli (grape-like clusters of cells that produce milk) can become  swollen with colostrum. Colostrum is thicker than mature breast  milk, and is yellowish or creamy in color. This protein-rich liquid  fulfills an infant’s nutrient needs during those early days. Although  low in volume, colostrum is packed with concentrated nutrition for  newborns. This special milk is high in fat-soluble vitamins, minerals,  and immunoglobulins (antibodies) that pass from the mother to the  baby. Immunoglobulins provide passive immunity for the newborn  and protect the baby from bacterial and viral diseases.16 Colostrum  also helps the baby to eliminate waste (meconium).  Two to four days after birth, colostrum is replaced by transitional  milk. Nursing the baby early (within the first hour of birth) and  frequently (8 to 14 times per 24 hours) helps to bring in this  increased volume of milk sooner. Transitional milk is a creamy,  usually yellow liquid that lasts for approximately two weeks and  includes high levels of fat, lactose, and water-soluble vitamins. It  16. American Pregnancy Association. (2019, October 14).  Breastfeeding: Overview.  http:/ /www.americanpregnancy.org/firstyearoflife/ breastfeedingoverview.htm.  Infancy  |  827\n",

As a new mother begins  to produce transitional milk, she typically notices an increase in the  weight and size of her breasts and a change in the volume and type  of liquid secreted.17  Mature milk is the final milk that a new mother produces. Its  composition varies from morning to night, from the beginning of  the feeding to the end, and from early postpartum to later in infancy  and toddlerhood. Breastmilk that is produced by mothers of  premature infants is higher in protein and calcium to meet the  needs of the preemie. Foremilk (the milk that comes at the  beginning of a feeding) tends to be lower in fat. Hind-milk comes  towards the end of a feeding containing higher levels of fat, which  helps the baby to feel satisfied and full. Combined, these two types  of milk ensure that a baby receives adequate nutrients to grow and  develop properly.18  About 87.5 percent of mature milk is water, which helps an infant  remain hydrated. The other 12.5 percent contains carbohydrates,  proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals which support energy and  growth. Similar to cow’s milk, the main carbohydrate of mature  breast milk is lactose. Breast milk contains the essential fatty acids,  linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid, and other fats that are  important for development such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).  In terms of protein, breast milk contains more whey than casein  17. American Pregnancy Association. (2019, October 14).

            "(which is the reverse of cow’s milk). Whey is much easier for infants  to digest than casein. Casein and whey make a complete protein  with all of the essential amino acids. Another protein in breastmilk,  lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein  that helps keep iron away  from pathogenic bacteria and facilitates the absorption of iron into  an infant’s bloodstream.  For most vitamins and minerals, breast milk provides adequate  amounts for growth and maintenance of optimal health. Although  the absolute amounts of some micronutrients are low, they are  more efficiently absorbed by infants from breast milk. Other  essential components include digestive enzymes that help a baby  digest the breast milk. Human milk also provides the hormones and  growth factors that help a newborn to develop.  Diet and Milk Quality  A mother’s health habits can impact milk production and quality. As  during pregnancy, lactating mothers should avoid illegal substances  and cigarettes. Some legal drugs and herbal products can be  harmful as well, so it is helpful to discuss them with a healthcare  professional. In some rare cases, mothers may need to avoid certain  things, such as dairy or spicy foods, that can produce gas in  sensitive infants. Lactating women can drink alcohol, though they  must avoid breastfeeding until the alcohol has completely cleared  from their milk. Typically, this takes two to three hours for 12 ounces  of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of liquor, depending on  Infancy  |  829\n",

Benefits of Breastfeeding  Breastfeeding has a number of benefits, both for the mother and for  the child. Breast milk contains immunoglobulins, enzymes, immune  factors, and white blood cells. As a result, breastfeeding boosts  the baby’s immune system and lowers the incidence of diarrhea,  respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal infections, and ear infections.  Breastfed babies also are less likely to develop asthma and allergies,  and breastfeeding lowers the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.  In addition, human milk encourages the growth of a healthy  microbiome (the bacteria in an infant’s intestinal tract). Most of  these benefits remain after an infant has been weaned from breast  milk. Some studies suggest other possible long-term effects. For  example, breast milk may improve an infant’s intelligence and  protect against Type 1 diabetes and obesity, although research is  ongoing in these areas.20  Breastfeeding has a number of other important benefits. It is  19. LaFleur, E. (2019, July 3). Breast-feeding and alcohol: Is it  okay to drink?.

Breastfed infants are sick less often than bottle-fed  infants. Breastfeeding is more sustainable and results in less plastic  waste and other trash. Breastfeeding can also save families money  because it typically saves over $1,200 per year in the US over  purchasing formula. Other benefits include that breast milk is  always ready. It does not have to be mixed, heated, or prepared.  Also, breast milk is sterile and is always at the right temperature.  In addition, the skin-to-skin contact of breastfeeding promotes  a close bond between mother and baby, which is an important  emotional and psychological benefit. The practice also provides  health benefits for the mother. Breastfeeding reduces the risk of  Type 2 Diabetes in the mother and infant. Studies have also shown  that breastfeeding reduces the risk of breast and ovarian cancers.21  The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative  In 1991, the WHO and UNICEF launched the Baby- Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI), which works to ensure  that all maternity care facilities, including hospitals and  free-standing facilities, become centers of breastfeeding  support. A maternity care facility can be denoted as “baby- friendly” when it does not accept free infant formula and  has implemented The Ten Steps to Successful  21. National Cancer Institute.

These steps include having a written policy  on breastfeeding communicated to health-care staff on a  routine basis, informing all new mothers about the benefits  and management of breastfeeding, showing new mothers  how to breastfeed their infants, and how to maintain  lactation, and giving newborns no food or drink other than  breast milk, unless medically indicated. Since the BFHI  began, more than fifteen thousand facilities in 134  countries, from Benin to Bangladesh, have been deemed  “baby friendly.” As a result, more mothers are breastfeeding  their newborns and infant health has improved, in both the  developed world and in developing nations.22 For  information on the Baby-Friendly Initiative in the US, see:  https:/ /www.babyfriendlyusa.org.  Barriers to Breastfeeding  Although breast milk is ideal for almost all infants, there are some  challenges that nursing mothers may face when starting and  continuing to breastfeed their infants. These obstacles include  painful engorgement or fullness in the breasts, often around day  3 to 5 postpartum, sore and tender nipples, lack of comfort or  confidence in public, and lack of accommodation to breastfeed or  express milk in the workplace.  One of the first challenges nursing mothers face is learning how  22. UNICEF. The baby-friendly hospital initiative.  http:/ /www.unicef.org/programme/breastfeeding/ baby.htm  832  |  Infancy\n",

Improper position  and latching usually results in pain for the mother and inadequate  intake for the infant, which could slow growth and development.  However, all International Board Certified Lactation Consultants  (IBCLCs) and most Obstetric nurses are trained to help new mothers  learn the proper technique. Some registered dietitians are trained in  lactation support as well.  A very helpful position for new mothers is  called the “Laid-Back Nursing” position, and it usually helps mother  and baby to feel more comfortable, and helps baby to latch on  without causing any nipple pain.

Contraindications to Breastfeeding  Although there are numerous benefits to breastfeeding, in some  cases there are also risks that must be considered. In the developed  world, a new mother with HIV should not breastfeed, because the  infection can be transmitted through breast milk. These women  typically have access to infant formula and water that is safe, and  can be used as a replacement for breast milk. However, in  developing nations where HIV infection rates are high and  acceptable infant formula can be difficult to find, many newborns  would be deprived of the nutrients they need to develop and grow.  Also, inappropriate or contaminated infant formulas cause 1.5  million infant deaths each year. As a result, the WHO recommends  that women infected with HIV in the developing world should nurse  Infancy  |  833\n",
            "their infants while taking antiretroviral medications to lower the  risk of transmission.23 In any case, combination feeding (formula  and breastmilk together) is not recommended for mothers who are  HIV positive because the risk of transmitting HIV to the infant is  higher than either breastfeeding or formula feeding alone.  Breastfeeding also is not recommended for women undergoing  radiation or chemotherapy treatment for cancer. Additionally, if an  infant is diagnosed with galactosemia, meaning an inability to  process the simple sugar galactose, the child must be on a  galactose-free diet, which excludes breast milk. This genetic  disorder is a very rare condition, however, and only affects 1 in  thirty- to sixty-thousand newborns.24 When breastfeeding is  contraindicated for any reason, feeding a baby formula enables  parents and caregivers to meet their newborn’s nutritional needs.  Bottle-Feeding  Most women can breastfeed when given sufficient education and  support. However, as discussed, a small percentage of women are  unable to breastfeed their infants, while others choose not to. For  parents who choose to bottle-feed, infant formula provides a  balance of nutrients. However, not all formulas are the same and  there are important considerations that parents and caregivers  must weigh. Standard formulas use cow’s milk as a base.

Often parents start their babies on soy formula  because they incorrectly assume that soy formula will reduce  allergies and other health problems, but this is not the case.  Soy- based formulas are sometimes given to infants who develop  diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, colic, or abdominal pain, but more  often these babies are put on hydrolysate formula to address these  concerns. Hypoallergenic protein hydrolysate formulas are given  to infants who are allergic to cow’s milk and soy protein, or who  have trouble tolerating them. This type of formula uses hydrolyzed  protein, meaning that the protein is broken down into amino acids  and small peptides, which makes it easier to digest, and makes it less  likely to trigger gastrointestinal distress.  Preterm infant formulas are given to premature and low birth  weight infants, if breast milk is unavailable. Preterm infant formulas  have 24 calories per fluid ounce and are given until the infant  reaches a desired weight. These formulas are also higher in protein,  calcium, and phosphorus to meet the special needs of premature  infants.  Infant formula comes in three basic types:  1. Powder that requires mixing with water. This is the least  expensive type of formula.  2. Concentrates, which are liquids that must be diluted with  water. This type is slightly more expensive.  3. Ready-to-use liquids that can be poured directly into bottles.  This is the most expensive type of formula. However, it  requires no preparation. Ready-to-use formulas are used when  a safe and sanitary water supply is not available. Ready-to-use  formulas are also convenient for traveling.  Most babies need about 2.5 ounces of formula per pound of body  weight each day. Therefore, the average infant consumes about 24  fluid ounces of breastmilk or formula per day, or one ounce per  hour. If an infant sleeps for 2 hours, they often consume 2 ounces  Infancy  |  835\n",
            "of breastmilk or formula at their next feeding. When preparing  formula, parents and caregivers should carefully follow the mixing  instructions and safety guidelines, since an infant has an immature  immune system. All equipment used in formula preparation should  be sterilized for newborns, and especially premature infants.  Prepared, unused formula should be refrigerated to prevent  bacterial growth. A partially finished bottle of infant formula should  be discarded after 1 hour. Parents must make sure not to use  contaminated water to mix formula in order to prevent foodborne  or other illnesses. Follow the instructions for powdered and  concentrated formula carefully—formula that is overly diluted will  not  provide  adequate  calories  and  protein,  while  overly  concentrated formula provides too much protein and too little  water which can challenge immature kidneys and lead to  dehydration.  Around 6 months of age, infants can start sipping expressed  breast milk, infant formula, or water from a cup. By 12 to 14 months  of age, children should be using a cup for all liquids.  It is important to note again that both the American Academy  of Pediatrics and the WHO state that breast milk is far superior to  infant formula.

            "Breast Milk  Bottle Formula  Antibodies and lactoferrin in breast  milk protect infants.  Formula does not contain  immunoprotective factors.  The iron in breast milk is absorbed  more easily. Because the iron is bound  to lactoferrin, it is not available for  bacteria in the gut  to use as a growth  factor.  Formula contains more iron  than breast milk, but it is not  absorbed as easily, and the iron  is a growth factor for pathogenic  microbes.  The feces that babies produce do not  smell because breastfed infants have  different bacteria in the gut.  The feces that bottle-fed infants  produce tends to have a  foul-smelling odor.  Breast milk is always available and is  always at the correct temperature.  Formula must be prepared,  refrigerated for storage, and  warmed before it is given to an  infant.  Breastfed infants are less likely to  have constipation.  Bottle-fed infants are more  likely to have constipation.  Breastfeeding ostensibly is free,  though purchasing optional supplies  such as a pump and bottles to express  milk does require some expense.  Formula must be purchased and  is expensive, typically costing  over $1,200 in the first year.  Breast milk contains the fatty acids  DHA and EPA, which are vital for brain  and vision development.

            "fruits, infant cereal, and dairy products such as yogurt, but not  infant formula. Infant formula is a substitute, not a complement to  breastmilk.  Infants should not consume solid foods prior to six months  because most solids are less nutritious than breastmilk. Eating  solids before 6 months of age usually means drinking less breast  milk and is associated with more ear infections and respiratory  infections. If parents try to feed an infant who is too young or is not  ready, their tongue will push the food out; this is called an extrusion  reflex. After six months, the suck-swallow reflexes are not as strong,  and infants can hold up their heads and move them around, both of  which make eating solid foods more feasible.  Solid baby foods can be bought commercially or prepared from  regular food using a food processor, blender, food mill, or grinder at  home. By nine months to a year, infants are able to chew soft foods  and can eat solids that are well chopped or mashed. Infants who are  fed solid foods before 4 months of age are susceptible to developing  food allergies. Therefore, as parents and caregivers introduce solids,  they should feed their child only one new food at a time, to help  identify allergic responses or food intolerances. An iron supplement  is also recommended at this time. Rice is no longer recommended  for a first infant food because of its high arsenic content. When  cereals are introduced, parents can try baby oats or baby wheat.

Research shows that nursing mothers  who attempt to ward off allergies in their infants by eliminating  certain foods may do more harm than good. According to the  American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, mothers  who avoided certain dairy products showed decreased levels in  their breast milk of an immunoglobulin specific to cow’s milk. This  antibody is thought to protect against the development of allergies  in children. Even when an infant is at higher risk for food allergies,  there is no evidence that alterations in a mother’s diet make a  difference. And, it is possible that continuing breastfeeding when  introducing solid foods in the infant diet may help prevent allergies.

The most common type of newborn  jaundice and can affect up to 60 percent of full-term babies in  the first week of life.  • Breast-milk jaundice. The name for a condition that persists  after physiologic jaundice subsides in otherwise healthy babies  and can last for three to twelve weeks after birth. Breast-milk  jaundice tends to be genetic and there is no known cause,  although it may be linked to a substance in the breast milk that  blocks the breakdown of bilirubin. However, that does not  mean breastfeeding should be stopped. As long as bilirubin  levels are monitored, the disorder rarely leads to serious  complications.  • “Inadequate breastfeeding jaundice”. Occurs when an infant  does not get enough milk. This may happen because a  newborn does not get a good start breastfeeding, does not  latch on to the mother’s breast properly, or is given other  substances that interfere with breastfeeding (such as juice).  Treatment includes increased feedings, with help from a  lactation consultant to ensure that the baby takes in adequate  amounts.  Newborn jaundice is more common in a breastfed baby and tends  to last a bit longer. If jaundice is suspected, a pediatrician will run  blood tests to measure the amount of bilirubin in an infant’s blood.

The toddler years pose interesting challenges for parents or other  caregivers, as children learn how to eat on their own and begin to  develop personal preferences. However, with the proper diet and  guidance, toddlers can continue to grow and develop at a healthy  rate.  Nutritional Requirements  MyPlate may be used as a guide for the toddler’s diet  (http:/ /www.choosemyplate.gov/preschoolers.html). A toddler’s  serving sizes should be approximately one-quarter that of an adult’s.  One way to estimate serving sizes for young children is one  tablespoon for each year of life. For example, a two-year-old child  would be served 2 tablespoons of fruits or vegetables at a meal,  while a four-year-old would be given 4 tablespoons, or a quarter  cup. Here is an example of a toddler-sized meal:  • 1 ounce of meat or chicken, or 2 to 3 tablespoons of beans  • One-quarter slice of whole-grain bread  • 1 to 2 tablespoons of cooked vegetable  • 1 to 2 tablespoons of fruit  Toddler Years  |  853\n",
            "Energy  The energy requirements for ages two to three are about 1,000 to  1,400 calories a day. In general, a toddler needs to consume about  40 calories for every inch of height. For example, a young child who  measures 32 inches should take in an average of 1,300 calories a day.  However, the recommended caloric intake varies with each child’s  level of activity. Toddlers require small, frequent, nutritious snacks  and meals to satisfy energy requirements. The amount of food a  toddler needs from each food group depends on daily calorie needs.  See Table 13.6 “Serving Sizes for Toddlers” for some examples.  Table 13.6 Serving Sizes for Toddlers  Food Group  Daily Serving  Examples  Grains  About 3-5 ounces of grains per day, ideally whole  grains  • 3 slices of br • 1 slice of brea rice or pasta Proteins  2-4 ounces of meat, poultry, fish, eggs, or legumes  • 1 ounce of lea • 1 ounce of fis Fruits  1-1.5 cups of fresh, frozen, canned, and/or dried  fruits, or 100 percent fruit juice  • 1 small apple • 1 cup of slice • 1 large banan Vegetables  1-1.5 cups of raw and/or cooked vegetables  • 1 cup of pure potato, chop Dairy  Products  2-2.5 cups per day  • 2 cups of fat- • 1 cup of fat-f • 1 cup of fat-f 854  |  Toddler Years\n",

Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.  https:/ /www.eatright.org/food/nutrition/dietary-guidelines- and-myplate/what-and-how-much-should-my-preschooler-be- eating  Macronutrients  For carbohydrate intake, the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution  Range (AMDR) is 45 to 65 percent of daily calories (113 to 163 grams  for 1,000 daily calories). Toddlers’ needs increase to support their  body and brain development. The RDA of protein is 5 to 20 percent  of daily calories (13 to 50 grams for 1,000 daily calories). The AMDR  for fat for toddlers is 30 to 40 percent of daily calories (33 to 44  grams for 1,000 daily calories). Essential fatty acids are vital for the  development of the eyes, along with nerve and other types of tissue.  However, toddlers should not consume foods with high amounts of  trans fats and saturated fats. Instead, young children require the  equivalent of 3 teaspoons of healthy oils, such as canola oil, each  day.  Micronutrients  As a child grows bigger, the demands for micronutrients increase.  These needs for vitamins and minerals can be met with a balanced  diet, with a few exceptions. According to the American Academy of  Pediatrics, toddlers and children of all ages need 600 international  units of vitamin D per day. Vitamin D-fortified milk and cereals can  help to meet this need. However, toddlers who do not get enough of  this micronutrient should receive a supplement. Pediatricians may  also prescribe a fluoride supplement for toddlers who live in areas  Toddler Years  |  855\n",

Learning How to Handle Food  As children grow older, they enjoy taking care of themselves, which  includes self-feeding. During this phase, it is important to offer  children foods that they can handle on their own and that help them  avoid choking and other hazards. Examples include fresh fruits that  have been sliced into pieces, orange or grapefruit sections, peas  or potatoes that have been mashed for safety, a cup of yogurt,  and whole-grain bread or bagels cut into pieces. Even with careful  preparation and training, the learning process can be messy. As a  result, parents and other caregivers can help children learn how to  feed themselves by providing the following:  • small utensils that fit a young child’s hand  • small cups that will not tip over easily  • plates with edges to prevent food from falling off  • small servings on a plate  • high chairs, booster seats, or cushions to reach a table  Feeding Problems in the Toddler Years  During the toddler years, parents may face a number of problems  related to food and nutrition. Possible obstacles include difficulty  helping a young child overcome a fear of new foods, or fights over  messy habits at the dinner table. Even in the face of problems  and confrontations, parents and other caregivers must make sure  their preschooler has nutritious choices at every meal. For example,  856  |  Toddler Years\n",
            "even if a child stubbornly resists eating vegetables, parents should  continue to provide them. Before long, the child may change their  mind, and develop a taste for foods once abhorred. It is important to  remember this is the time to establish or reinforce healthy habits.    Nutritionist Ellyn Satter states that feeding is a responsibility that  is split between parent and child. According to Satter, parents are  responsible for what their infants eat, while infants are responsible  for how much they eat. In the toddler years and beyond, parents are  responsible for what they offer their children to eat, when they eat,  and where they eat, while children are responsible for how much  food they eat and whether they eat. Satter states that the role of a  parent or a caregiver in feeding includes the following:  • selecting and preparing food  • providing regular meals and snacks  • making mealtimes pleasant  • showing children what they must learn about mealtime  behavior  • avoiding letting children eat in between meal- or snack-times2  Picky Eaters  The parents of toddlers are likely to notice a sharp drop in their  child’s appetite. Children at this stage are often picky about what  they want to eat because they just aren’t as hungry. They may turn  2. Satter, E. (2016).

They also can be unpredictable  about what they want to consume for specific meals or at particular  times of the day. Although it may seem as if toddlers should increase  their food intake to match their level of activity, there is a good  reason for picky eating. A child’s growth rate slows after infancy, and  toddlers ages two and three do not require as much food.  One way to encourage a picky eater to try healthy foods is to get  them involved in age-appropriate tasks in meal preparation. Even  small toddlers can tear up lettuce leaves for a salad, or arrange fruit  and cheese slices on a plate.

According to the US Department of Health and  Human Services, in the past thirty years, obesity rates have more  than doubled for all children, including infants and toddlers.3  Almost 10 percent of infants and toddlers weigh more than they  3. Ogden, C., & Carroll, M.

In 2012, 12.8% of Hawai‘i WIC (low- income) participants ages two to four years were overweight and  10.2% had obesity.567 One study that investigated 2000-2010 data  for children ages two to eight years in 51 communities in 11 United  States Affiliated Pacific (USAP) jurisdictions found that 14.4% of the  study population was overweight and 14% had obesity.8  4. Institute of Medicine.

            "Obesity during early childhood tends to linger as a child matures  and cause health problems later in life. There are a number of  reasons for this growing problem. One is a lack of time. Parents and  other caregivers who are constantly on the go may find it difficult  to fit home-cooked meals into a busy schedule and may turn to  fast food and other conveniences that are quick and easy, but not  nutritionally sound. Another contributing factor is a lack of access  to fresh fruits and vegetables. This is a problem particularly in low- income neighborhoods where local stores and markets may not  stock fresh produce or may have limited options. Physical inactivity  is also a factor, as toddlers who live a sedentary lifestyle are more  likely to be overweight or obese. Another contributor is a lack of  breastfeeding support. Children who were breastfed as infants have  lower rates of obesity than children who were bottle-fed.  To prevent or address toddler obesity parents and caregivers can  do the following:  • Eat at the kitchen table instead of in front of a television to  monitor what and how much a child eats.  • Offer a child healthy portions. The size of a toddler’s fist is an  appropriate serving size.  • Plan time for physical activity, about sixty minutes or more per  day. Toddlers should have no more than sixty minutes of  sedentary activity, such as watching television, per day.  Early Childhood Caries  Early childhood caries remain a potential problem during the  toddler years. The risk of early childhood caries continues as  al-2016-Prevalence_of_obesity_and_acanthosis_nigric ans.-Medicine.pdf  860  |  Toddler Years\n",
            "children begin to consume more foods with a high sugar content.  According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,  children between ages of two and five consume about 200 calories  of added sugar per day.9 Therefore, parents with toddlers should  avoid processed foods, such as snacks from vending machines, and  sugary beverages, such as soda. Parents also need to instruct a child  on brushing their teeth at this time to help a toddler develop healthy  habits and avoid tooth decay. Generally, children need help brushing  their teeth until they are 5 years old.  Iron-Deficiency Anemia  An infant who switches to solid foods, but does not eat enough  iron-rich foods, can develop iron-deficiency anemia. This condition  occurs when an iron-deprived body cannot produce enough  hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen  throughout the body. The inadequate supply of hemoglobin for new  blood cells results in anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia causes a  number of problems including weakness, pale skin, shortness of  breath, and irritability. It can also result in intellectual, behavioral,  or motor problems. In infants and toddlers, iron-deficiency anemia  can occur as young children are weaned from iron-rich foods, such  as breast milk and iron-fortified formula. They begin to eat solid  foods that may not provide enough of this nutrient. As a result,  their iron stores become diminished at a time when this nutrient is  critical for brain growth and development.    9. Ervin, R. B., Kit, B. K., Carroll, M. D., & Ogden, C. L. (2012).

            "There are steps that parents and caregivers can take to prevent  iron-deficiency anemia, such as adding more iron-rich foods to  a child’s diet, including lean meats, fish, poultry, eggs, legumes,  and iron-enriched whole-grain breads and cereals. A toddler’s diet  should provide 7 to 10 milligrams of iron daily. Although milk is  critical for the bone-building calcium that it provides, intake should  not exceed the RDA to avoid displacing foods rich with iron.  Children may also be given a daily supplement, using infant vitamin  drops with iron or ferrous sulfate drops. If iron-deficiency anemia  does occur, treatment includes a dosage of 3 milligrams per  kilogram once daily before breakfast, usually in the form of a ferrous  sulfate syrup. Consuming vitamin C, such as orange juice, can also  help to improve iron absorption.10    Learning Activities  Technology Note: The second edition of the Human  Nutrition Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook  features interactive learning activities.  These activities are  available in the web-based textbook and not available in the  10. Louis A., Kazal J.R.

Early childhood encompasses infancy and the toddler years, from  birth through age three. The remaining part of childhood is the  period from ages four through eight and is the time when children  enter school. A number of critical physiological and emotional  changes take place during the life stage from childhood through  adolescences. Children’s attitudes and opinions about food deepen.  They not only begin taking their cues about food preferences from  family members, but also from peers and the larger culture. In  Hawai‘i, organizations such as the Kōkua Hawai‘i Foundation have  implemented school programs such as ‘Āina In Schools to connect  children to their local land, waters, and food. The program initiative  is to address childhood health issues by fostering healthy eating  habits by teaching and engaging youth about local and traditional  foods.1  Parents also greatly impact their child’s nutritional choices. This  time in a child’s life provides an opportunity for parents and other  caregivers to reinforce good eating habits and to introduce new  foods into the diet, while remaining mindful of a child’s preferences.  Parents should also serve as role models for their children, who will  1. About ‘Āina In Schools. Kōkua Hawai‘i Foundation.  https:/ /www.kokuahawaiifoundation.org/aina.

From  ages four to eight, school-aged children grow consistently, but at  a slower rate than infants and toddlers. They also experience the  loss of deciduous, or “baby,” teeth and the arrival of permanent  teeth, which typically begins at age six or seven. As new teeth come  Childhood  |  871\n",
            "in, many children have some malocclusion, or malposition, of their  teeth, which can affect their ability to chew food. Other changes  that affect nutrition include the influence of peers on dietary  choices and the kinds of foods offered by schools and afterschool  programs, which can make up a sizable part of a child’s diet. Food- related problems for young children can include tooth decay, food  sensitivities, and malnourishment. Also, excessive weight gain early  in life can lead to obesity into adolescence and adulthood.  At this life stage, a healthy diet facilitates physical and mental  development and helps to maintain health and wellness. School- aged children experience steady, consistent growth, with an average  growth rate of 2–3 inches (5–7 centimeters) in height and 4.5–6.5  pounds (2–3 kilograms) in weight per year. In addition, the rate  of growth for the extremities is faster than for the trunk, which  results in more adult-like proportions. Long-bone growth stretches  muscles and ligaments, which results in many children experiencing  “growing pains,” at night, in particular.1  Energy  Children’s energy needs vary, depending on their growth and level  of physical activity. Energy requirements also vary according to  gender. Girls ages four to eight require 1,200 to 1,800 calories a  day, while boys need 1,200 to 2,000 calories daily, and, depending  on their activity level, maybe more. Also, recommended intakes of  macronutrients and most micronutrients are higher relative to body  size, compared with nutrient needs during adulthood. Therefore,  1. Polan EU, Taylor DR.

            "children should be provided nutrient-dense food at meal- and  snack-time. However, it is important not to overfeed children, as  this can lead to childhood obesity, which is discussed in the next  section. Parents and other caregivers can turn to the MyPlate  website for guidance: http:/ /www.choosemyplate.gov/.  Macronutrients  For carbohydrates, the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution  Range (AMDR) is 45–65 percent of daily calories (which is a  recommended daily allowance of 135–195 grams for 1,200 daily  calories). Carbohydrates high in fiber should make up the bulk of  intake. The AMDR for protein is 10–30 percent of daily calories  (30–90 grams for 1,200 daily calories). Children have a high need for  protein to support muscle growth and development. High levels of  essential fatty acids are needed to support growth (although not as  high as in infancy and the toddler years). As a result, the AMDR for  fat is 25–35 percent of daily calories (33–47 grams for 1,200 daily  calories). Children should get 17–25 grams of fiber per day.  Micronutrients  Micronutrient needs should be met with foods first. Parents and  caregivers should select a variety of foods from each food group  to ensure that nutritional requirements are met. Because children  grow rapidly, they require foods that are high in iron, such as lean  meats, legumes, fish, poultry, and iron-enriched cereals. Adequate  fluoride is crucial to support strong teeth. One of the most  important  micronutrient  requirements  during  childhood  is  adequate calcium and vitamin D intake.

            "Therefore, it is critical that parents and caregivers direct children  toward healthy choices.  One way to encourage children to eat healthy foods is to make  meal- and snack-time fun and interesting. Parents should include  children in food planning and preparation, for example selecting  items while grocery shopping or helping to prepare part of a meal,  such as making a salad. At this time, parents can also educate  children about kitchen safety. It might be helpful to cut sandwiches,  meats, or pancakes into small or interesting shapes. In addition,  parents should offer nutritious desserts, such as fresh fruits, instead  of calorie-laden cookies, cakes, salty snacks, and ice cream. Also,  studies show that children who eat family meals on a frequent basis  consume more nutritious foods.2  Children and Malnutrition  Malnutrition is a problem many children face, in both developing  nations and the developed world. Even with the wealth of food  in North America, many children grow up malnourished, or even  hungry. The US Census Bureau characterizes households into the  following groups:  • food secure  • food insecure without hunger  • food insecure with moderate hunger  2. Research on the Benefits of Family Meals.

            "• food insecure with severe hunger  Millions of children grow up in food-insecure households with  inadequate diets due to both the amount of available food and the  quality of food. In the United States, about 20 percent of households  with children are food insecure to some degree. In half of those,  only adults experience food insecurity, while in the other half both  adults and children are considered to be food insecure, which  means that children did not have access to adequate, nutritious  meals at times.3  Growing up in a food-insecure household can lead to a number  of problems. Deficiencies in iron, zinc, protein, and vitamin A can  result in stunted growth, illness, and limited development. Federal  programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, the School  Breakfast Program, and Summer Feeding Programs, work to address  the risk of hunger and malnutrition in school-aged children. They  help to fill the gaps and provide children living in food-insecure  households with greater access to nutritious meals.  The National School Lunch Program  Beginning with preschool, children consume at least one of their  meals in a school setting. Many children receive both breakfast and  lunch outside of the home. Therefore, it is important for schools  to provide meals that are nutritionally sound. In the United States,  more than thirty-one million children from low-income families  are given meals provided by the National School Lunch Program.  This federally-funded program offers low-cost or free lunches to  3. Coleman-Jensen A, et al. (2011). Household Food Security  in the United States in 2010.

School lunches must  meet the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and need to provide  one-third of the RDAs for protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, and  calcium. However, local authorities make the decisions about what  foods to serve and how they are prepared.4  The Healthy School Lunch Campaign works to improve the food  served to children in school and to promote children’s short- and  long-term health by educating government officials, school officials,  food-service workers, and parents. Sponsored by the Physicians  Committee for Responsible Medicine, this organization encourages  schools to offer more low-fat, cholesterol-free options in school  cafeterias and in vending machines.5  Food Allergies and Food Intolerance  As discussed previously, the development of food allergies is a  concern during the toddler years.

Recent studies show that three million children  under age eighteen are allergic to at least one type of food.6  Some of the most common allergenic foods include peanuts, milk,  eggs, soy, wheat, and shellfish. An allergy occurs when a protein  in food triggers an immune response, which results in the release  of antibodies, histamine, and other defenders that attack foreign  bodies. Possible symptoms include itchy skin, hives, abdominal pain,  vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea. Symptoms usually develop within  minutes to hours after consuming a food allergen. Children can  outgrow a food allergy, especially allergies to wheat, milk, eggs, or  soy.  Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening reaction that results in difficulty  breathing, swelling in the mouth and throat, decreased blood  pressure, shock, or even death. Milk, eggs, wheat, soybeans, fish,  shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts are the most likely to trigger this  type of response.

It is a result of  the small intestine’s inability to produce enough of the enzyme  lactase, which is produced by the small intestine. Symptoms of  lactose intolerance usually affect the GI tract and can include  bloating, abdominal pain, gas, nausea, and diarrhea. An intolerance  is best managed by making dietary changes and avoiding any foods  that trigger the reaction.8  The Threat of Lead Toxicity  There is a danger of lead toxicity, or lead poisoning, among school- aged children. Lead is found in plumbing in old homes, in lead-based  paint, and occasionally in the soil. Contaminated food and water can  increase exposure and result in hazardous lead levels in the blood.  Children under age six are especially vulnerable. They may consume  items tainted with lead, such as chipped, lead-based paint. Another  common exposure is lead dust in carpets, with the dust flaking off  of paint on walls. When children play or roll around on carpets  coated with lead, they are in jeopardy. Lead is indestructible, and  once it has been ingested it is difficult for the human body to alter  or remove it. It can quietly build up in the body for months, or even  years, before the onset of symptoms. Lead toxicity can damage the  brain and central nervous system, resulting in impaired thinking,  reasoning, and perception.  8. Lactose Intolerance.

            "Treatment for lead poisoning includes removing the child from  the source of contamination and extracting lead from the body.  Extraction may involve chelation therapy, which binds with lead  so it can be excreted in urine. Another treatment protocol, EDTA  therapy,  involves  administering  a  drug  called  ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  to  remove  lead  from  the  bloodstream of patients with levels greater than 45 mcg/dL.9  Fortunately, lead toxicity is highly preventable. It involves  identifying potential hazards, such as lead paint and pipes, and  removing them before children are exposed to them.

According to the DRI recommendations, adolescence is divided into  two age groups: 9 through 13 years, and 14 through 18 years. Some  of the important physiological changes that take place during this  stage include the development of primary sex characteristics, or  the reproductive organs, along with the onset of menstruation in  females. This life stage is also characterized by the appearance of  secondary sex characteristics, such as the growth of facial and body  hair, the development of breasts in girls, and the deepening of the  voice in boys. Other physical changes include rapid growth and  alterations in body proportions.1 All of these changes, as well as  1. Polan EU, Taylor DR. (2003).

            "the accompanying mental and emotional adjustments, should be  supported with sound nutrition.  The Onset of Puberty (Ages 9 through 13 years)  This period of physical development is divided into two phases.  The first phase involves height increases from 20 to 25 percent.  Puberty is second to the prenatal period in terms of rapid growth  as the long bones stretch to their final, adult size. Girls grow 2–8  inches (5–20 centimeters) taller, while boys grow 4–12 inches (10–30  centimeters) taller. The second phase involves weight gain related to  the development of bone, muscle, and fat tissue. Also in the midst of  puberty, the sex hormones trigger the development of reproductive  organs and secondary sexual characteristics, such as pubic hair.  Girls also develop “curves,” while boys become broader and more  muscular.2  Energy and Macronutrients  The energy requirements for preteens differ according to gender,  growth, and activity level. For ages nine to thirteen, girls should  consume about 1,400 to 2,200 calories per day and boys should  consume 1,600 to 2,600 calories per day.

            "who regularly participate in sports or exercise need to eat a greater  number of calories to account for increased energy expenditures.  For carbohydrates, the AMDR is 45 to 65 percent of daily calories  (which is a recommended daily allowance of 158–228 grams for  1,400–1,600 daily calories). Carbohydrates that are high in fiber  should make up the bulk of intake. The AMDR for protein is 10 to 30  percent of daily calories (35–105 grams for 1,400 daily calories for  girls and 40–120 grams for 1,600 daily calories for boys). The AMDR  for fat is 25 to 35 percent of daily calories (39–54 grams for 1,400  daily calories for girls and 44–62 grams for 1,600 daily calories for  boys), depending on caloric intake and activity level.  Micronutrients  Key vitamins needed during puberty include vitamins D, K, and  B12. Adequate calcium intake is essential for building bone and  preventing osteoporosis later in life.

Girls stop  growing taller around age sixteen, while boys continue to grow  taller until ages eighteen to twenty. One of the psychological and  emotional changes that takes place during this life stage includes  the desire for independence as adolescents develop individual  identities apart from their families.1 As teenagers make more and  more of their dietary decisions, parents or other caregivers and  authority figures should guide them toward appropriate, nutritious  choices. One way that teenagers assert their independence is by  choosing what to eat. They have their own money to purchase food  1. Polan EU, Taylor DR. (2003). Journey Across the LifeSpan:  Human Development and Health Promotion. Philadelphia:  F. A. Davis Company, 171–76.  Late Adolescence  |  889\n",
            "and tend to eat more meals away from home. Older adolescents  also can be curious and open to new ideas, which includes trying  new kinds of food and experimenting with their diet. For example,  teens will sometimes skip a main meal and snack instead. That is  not necessarily problematic. Their choice of food is more important  than the time or place.  However, too many poor choices can make young people  nutritionally vulnerable. Teens should be discouraged from eating  fast food, which has a high fat and sugar content, or frequenting  convenience stores and using vending machines, which typically  offer poor nutritional selections. Other challenges that teens may  face include obesity and eating disorders. At this life stage, young  people still need guidance from parents and other caregivers about  nutrition-related matters. It can be helpful to explain to young  people how healthy eating habits can support activities they enjoy,  such as skateboarding or dancing, or connect to their desires or  interests, such as a lean figure, athletic performance, or improved  cognition.  As during puberty, growth and development during adolescence  differs in males than in females. In teenage girls, fat assumes a larger  percentage of body weight, while teenage boys experience greater  muscle and bone increases. For both, primary and secondary sex  characteristics have fully developed and the rate of growth slows  with the end of puberty. Also, the motor functions of an older  adolescent are comparable to those of an adult.2 Again, adequate  nutrition and healthy choices support this stage of growth and  development.  2. Polan EU, Taylor DR.

            "Energy and Macronutrients  Adolescents have increased appetites due to increased nutritional  requirements. Nutrient needs are greater in adolescence than at any  other time in the life cycle, except during pregnancy. The energy  requirements for ages fourteen to eighteen are 1,800 to 2,400  calories for girls and 2,000 to 3,200 calories for boys, depending on  activity level. The extra energy required for physical development  during the teenaged years should be obtained from foods that  provide nutrients instead of “empty calories.” Also, teens who  participate in sports must make sure to meet their increased energy  needs.  Older adolescents are more responsible for their dietary choices  than younger children, but parents and caregivers must make sure  that  teens  continue  to  meet  their  nutrient  needs.  For  carbohydrates, the AMDR is 45 to 65 percent of daily calories  (203–293 grams for 1,800 daily calories). Adolescents require more  servings of grain than younger children, and should eat whole  grains, such as wheat, oats, barley, and brown rice. The Institute of  Medicine recommends higher intakes of protein for growth in the  adolescent population. The AMDR for protein is 10 to 30 percent  of daily calories (45–135 grams for 1,800 daily calories), and lean  proteins, such as meat, poultry, fish, beans, nuts, and seeds are  excellent ways to meet those nutritional needs.  The AMDR for fat is 25 to 35 percent of daily calories (50–70 grams  for 1,800 daily calories), and the AMDR for fiber is 25–34 grams per  day, depending on daily calories and activity level. It is essential for  young athletes and other physically active teens to intake enough  fluids, because they are at a higher risk for becoming dehydrated.  Late Adolescence  |  891\n",
            "Micronutrients  Micronutrient recommendations for adolescents are mostly the  same as for adults, though children this age need more of certain  minerals to promote bone growth (e.g., calcium and phosphorus,  along with iron and zinc for girls). Again, vitamins and minerals  should be obtained from food first, with supplementation for  certain micronutrients only (such as iron).  The most important micronutrients for adolescents are calcium,  vitamin D, vitamin A, and iron. Adequate calcium and vitamin D are  essential for building bone mass. The recommendation for calcium  is 1,300 milligrams for both boys and girls. Low-fat milk and cheeses  are excellent sources of calcium and help young people avoid  saturated fat and cholesterol. It can also be helpful for adolescents  to consume products fortified with calcium, such as breakfast  cereals and orange juice. Iron supports the growth of muscle and  lean body mass. Adolescent girls also need to ensure sufficient iron  intake as they start to menstruate. Girls ages twelve to eighteen  require 15 milligrams of iron per day. Increased amounts of vitamin  C from orange juice and other sources can aid in iron absorption.  Also, adequate fruit and vegetable intake allows for meeting vitamin  A needs. Table 14.3 “Micronutrient Levels during Older Adolescence”  shows the micronutrient recommendations for older adolescents,  which  differ  slightly  for  males  and  females,  unlike  the  recommendations for puberty.

Because eating disorders often lead to malnourishment,  adolescents with an eating disorder are deprived of the crucial  nutrients their still-growing bodies need.  Eating disorders involve extreme behavior related to food and  exercise. Sometimes referred to as “starving or stuffing,” they  encompass a group of conditions marked by under eating or  overeating. Some of these conditions include:  • Anorexia Nervosa. Anorexia nervosa is a potentially fatal  condition characterized by under eating and excessive weight  loss. People with this disorder are preoccupied with dieting,  calories, and food intake to an unhealthy degree. Anorexics  have a poor body image, which leads to anxiety, avoidance of  food, a rigid exercise regimen, fasting, and a denial of hunger.  The condition predominantly affects females. Between 0.5 and  1 percent of American women and girls suffer from this eating  disorder.  • Binge-Eating Disorder. People who suffer from binge-eating  disorder experience regular episodes of eating an extremely  large amount of food in a short period of time. Binge eating is a  compulsive behavior, and people who suffer from it typically  feel it is beyond their control. This behavior often causes  feelings of shame and embarrassment, and leads to obesity,  high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, Type 2 diabetes,  and other health problems. Both males and females suffer from  binge-eating disorder. It affects 1 to 5 percent of the  3. Eating Disorder Statistics.

People who  suffer from it partake in binge eating, followed by  compensatory behavior, such as self-induced vomiting, laxative  use, and compulsive exercise. As with anorexia, most people  with this condition are female. Approximately 1 to 2 percent of  American women and girls have this eating disorder.4  Eating disorders stem from stress, low self-esteem, and other  psychological and emotional issues. It is important for parents to  watch for signs and symptoms of these disorders, including sudden  weight loss, lethargy, vomiting after meals, and the use of appetite  suppressants. Eating disorders can lead to serious complications  or even be fatal if left untreated. Treatment includes cognitive,  behavioral, and nutritional therapy.  Childhood and Adolescent Obesity  Children need adequate caloric intake for growth, and it is  important not to impose very restrictive diets. However, exceeding  caloric requirements on a regular basis can lead to childhood  obesity, which has become a major problem in North America.  Nearly one of three US children and adolescents are overweight or  obese.5  4. Learn By Eating Disorder.

Obesity has a profound effect on self- esteem, energy, and activity level. Even more importantly, it is a  major risk factor for a number of diseases later in life, including  cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, stroke, hypertension, and  certain cancers.6  A percentile for body mass index (BMI) specific to age and sex is  used to determine if a child is overweight or obese. This is more  appropriate than the BMI categories used for adults because the  body composition of children varies as they develop, and differs  between boys and girls. If a child gains weight inappropriate to  growth, parents and caregivers should limit energy-dense,  nutrient-poor snack foods. In addition, it is extremely beneficial  to increase a child’s physical activity and limit sedentary activities,  facts/epidemic-childhood-obesity.

            "such as watching television, playing video games, or surfing the  Internet.  Programs to address childhood obesity can include behavior  modification, exercise counseling, psychological support or  therapy, family counseling, and family meal-planning advice. For  most, the goal is not weight loss, but rather allowing height to catch  up with weight as the child continues to grow. Rapid weight loss is  not recommended for preteens or younger children due to the risk  of deficiencies and stunted growth.  Avoiding Added Sugars  One major contributing factor to childhood obesity is the  consumption of added sugars. Added sugars include not only sugar  added to food at the table, but also are ingredients in items such as  bread, cookies, cakes, pies, jams, and soft drinks. The added sugar  in store-bought items may be listed as white sugar, brown sugar,  high-fructose corn syrup, honey, malt syrup, maple syrup, molasses,  anhydrous dextrose, crystal dextrose, and concentrated fruit juice.  (Not included are sugars that occur naturally in foods, such as the  lactose in milk or the fructose in fruits.) In addition, sugars are  often “hidden” in items added to foods after they’re prepared, such  as ketchup, salad dressing, and other condiments. According to  the National Center for Health Statistics, young children and  adolescents consume an average of 322 calories per day from added  sugars, or about 16 percent of daily calories.7  7. Ervin RB, Kit BK, Carroll MD.

            "The primary offenders are processed and packaged foods, along  with soda and other beverages. These foods are not only high in  sugar, they are also light in terms of nutrients and often take the  place of healthier options. Intake of added sugar should be limited  to 100–150 calories per day to discourage poor eating habits.  Tools for Change  The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans call for sixty  minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily for preteens  and teens. This includes aerobic activity, along with bone- and  muscle-strengthening exercises.8 However, many young people fall  far short of this goal. Preteens must be encouraged to lead more  active lifestyles to prevent or treat childhood obesity. In the United  States, the Let’s Move! campaign inspires kids to start exercising.  This program, launched in 2010 by First Lady Michelle Obama,  works to solve the problem of rising obesity rates among children,  preteens, and teens. It offers information to parents and educators,  works to provide healthier food choices in schools and afterschool  programs, and helps children become more active. One way the  program promotes physical activity is by encouraging preteens and  teens to find something they love to do. When kids find an activity  they enjoy, whether riding a bike, playing football, joining a soccer  team, or participating in a dance crew, they are more likely to get  Data Brief, 87. http:/ /www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ databriefs/db87.pdf.

Typically, a young adult who is active has  reached his or her physical peak and is in prime health. For example,  vital capacity, or the maximum amount of air that the lungs can  inhale and exhale, is at its peak between the ages of twenty and  forty.1 During this life stage, it important to continue to practice  good  nutrition.  Healthy  eating  habits  promote  metabolic  functioning, assist repair and regeneration, and prevent the  1. Polan EU, Taylor DR. (2003).

            "development of chronic conditions. In addition, the goals of a young  adult, such as beginning a career or seeking out romantic  relationships, can be supported with good habits. Proper nutrition  and adequate physical activity at this stage not only promote  wellness in the present, but also provide a solid foundation for the  future.  With the onset of adulthood, good nutrition can help young adults  enjoy an active lifestyle. The body of an adult does not need to  devote its energy and resources to support the rapid growth and  development that characterizes youth. However, the choices made  during those formative years can have a lasting impact. Eating habits  and preferences developed during childhood and adolescence  influence health and fitness into adulthood. Some adults have  gotten a healthy start and have established a sound diet and regular  activity program, which helps them remain in good condition from  young adulthood into the later years. Others carry childhood  obesity into adulthood, which adversely affects their health.  However, it is not too late to change course and develop healthier  habits and lifestyle choices. Therefore, adults must monitor their  dietary decisions and make sure their caloric intake provides the  energy that they require, without going into excess.  Energy and Macronutrients  Young men typically have higher nutrient needs than young women.  For ages nineteen to thirty, the energy requirements for women  are 1,800 to 2,400 calories, and 2,400 to 3,000 calories for men,  depending on activity level. These estimates do not include women  who are pregnant or breastfeeding, who require a higher energy  intake. For carbohydrates, the AMDR is 45 to 65 percent of daily  calories. All adults, young and old, should eat fewer energy-dense  carbohydrates, especially refined, sugar-dense sources, particularly  for those who lead a more sedentary lifestyle. The AMDR for protein  908  |  Young Adulthood\n",
            "is 10 to 35 percent of total daily calories, and should include a variety  of lean meat and poultry, eggs, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds. The  guidelines also recommend that adults eat two 4-ounce servings (or  one 8-ounce serving) of seafood per week.  It is also important to replace proteins that are high in trans  fats and saturated fat with ones that are lower in solid fats and  calories. All adults should limit total fat to 20 to 35 percent of  their daily calories and keep saturated fatty acids to less than 10  percent of total calories by replacing them with monounsaturated  and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Avoid trans fats by limiting foods  that contain synthetic sources, such as partially hydrogenated oils.  The AMDR for fiber is 22 to 28 grams per day for women and  28 to 34 grams per day for men. Soluble fiber may help improve  cholesterol and blood sugar levels, while insoluble fiber can help  prevent constipation.  Micronutrients  Micronutrient needs in adults differ slightly according to sex. Young  men and women who are very athletic and perspire a great deal also  require extra sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Males require  more of vitamins C and K, along with thiamine, riboflavin, and  niacin. Females require extra iron due to menstruation. Therefore,  it can be beneficial for some young adults to follow a daily  multivitamin regimen to help meet nutrient needs. But as always,  it is important to remember “food first, supplements second.” Table  15.1  “Micronutrient  Levels  during  Adulthood”  shows  the  micronutrient recommendations for adult men and women.

Fresh fruits and vegetables, including watermelon and cucumbers,  are excellent food sources of fluid. In addition, young adults should  avoid consuming excessive amounts of sodium. The health  consequences of high sodium intake include high blood pressure  and its complications. Therefore, it is best to limit sodium to less  than 2,300 milligrams per day.  Obesity during Adulthood  Obesity remains a major concern into young adulthood. For adults,  a BMI above 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI of 30 or higher  is obese. By that measurement, about two-thirds of all adults in the  United States are overweight or obese, with 35.7 percent considered  to be obese. 3 As during childhood and adolescence, physical  inactivity and poor dietary choices are major contributors to obesity  in adulthood. Solid fats, alcohol, and added sugars (SoFAAS) make  up 35 percent of total calories for most people, leading to high  2. Institute of Medicine. 2005.

            "Middle Age  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Middle age is defined as the period from age thirty-one to fifty. The  early period of this stage is very different from the end. For example,  during the early years of middle age, many women experience  pregnancy, childbirth, and lactation. In the latter part of this life  stage, women face perimenopause, which is a transition period that  leads up to menopause, or the end of menstruation. A number of  physical changes take place in the middle-aged years, including the  loss of bone mass in women due to dropping levels of estrogen  during menopause. In both men and women, visual acuity declines,  and by age forty there can be a decreased ability to see objects  at a close distance, a condition known as presbyopia.1 All of these  are signs of aging, as the human body begins to change in subtle  and not-so-subtle ways. However, a middle aged person can remain  vital, healthy, and near his or her physical peak with proper diet and  adequate exercise.  During this stage of the human life cycle, adults begin to  experience the first outward signs of aging. Wrinkles begin to  appear, joints ache after a highly active day, and body fat  accumulates. There is also a loss of muscle tone and elasticity in  the connective tissue.2 Many people in their late thirties and in  1. Polan EU, Taylor DR. (2003).

Wounds and other injuries also take longer to heal. Body  composition changes due to fat deposits in the trunk. To maintain  health and wellness during the middle-aged years and beyond, it is  important to:  • maintain a healthy body weight  • consume nutrient-dense foods  • drink alcohol moderately or not at all  • be a nonsmoker  • engage in moderate physical activity at least 150 minutes per  week  Energy and Macronutrients  The energy requirements for ages thirty-one to fifty are 1,800 to  2,200 calories for women and 2,200 to 3,000 calories for men,  depending on activity level. These estimates do not include women  who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Middle-aged adults must rely on  healthy food sources to meet these needs. In many parts of North  America, typical dietary patterns do not match the recommended  guidelines. For example, five foods—iceberg lettuce, frozen  potatoes,  fresh  potatoes,  potato  chips,  and  canned  tomatoes—account for over half of all vegetable intake.3 Following  3. Drewnowski A, Darmon, N.

The AMDRs for carbohydrates, protein, fat, fiber, and fluids  remain the same from young adulthood into middle age. It is  important to avoid putting on excess pounds and limiting an intake  of SoFAAS to help avoid cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other  chronic conditions.  Micronutrients  There are some differences, however, regarding micronutrients. For  men, the recommendation for magnesium increases to 420  milligrams daily, while middle-aged women should increase their  intake of magnesium to 320 milligrams per day. Other key vitamins  needed during the middle-aged years include folate and vitamins  B6 and B12 to prevent elevation of homocysteine, a byproduct of  metabolism  that  can  damage  arterial  walls  and  lead  to  atherosclerosis, a cardiovascular condition. Again, it is important to  meet nutrient needs with food first, then supplementation, such as  a daily multivitamin, if you can’t meet your needs through food.  Preventive/Defensive Nutrition  During the middle-aged years, preventive nutrition can promote  wellness and help organ systems to function optimally throughout  aging. Preventive nutrition is defined as dietary practices directed  toward reducing disease and promoting health and well-being.  Healthy eating in general—such as eating unrefined carbohydrates  instead of refined carbohydrates and avoiding trans fats and  saturated fats—helps to promote wellness. However, there are also  some things that people can do to target specific concerns. One  Middle Age  |  915\n",

These crucial nutrients are found in oily fish, including salmon,  mackerel, tuna, herring, cod, and halibut. Other beneficial fats that  are vital for healthy functioning include monounsaturated fats,  which are found in plant oils, avocados, peanuts, and pecans.  4. Voutilainen S, Nurmi T, Mursu J, Rissanen, TH.

            "Menopause  In the middle-aged years, women undergo a specific change that  has a major effect on their health. They begin the process of  menopause, typically in their late forties or early fifties. The ovaries  slowly cease to produce estrogen and progesterone, which results  in the end of menstruation. Menopausal symptoms can vary, but  often include hot flashes, night sweats, and mood changes. The  hormonal changes that occur during menopause can lead to a  number of physiological changes as well, including alterations in  body composition, such as weight gain in the abdominal area. Bone  loss is another common condition related to menopause due to  the loss of female reproductive hormones. Bone thinning increases  the risk of fractures, which can affect mobility and the ability to  complete everyday tasks, such as cooking, bathing, and dressing.6  Recommendations for women experiencing menopause or  perimenopause (the stage just prior to the end of the menstruation)  include:  • consuming a variety of whole grains, and other nutrient-dense  foods  • maintaining a diet high in fiber, low in fat, and low in sodium  • avoiding caffeine, spicy foods, and alcohol to help prevent hot  flashes  • eating foods rich in calcium, or taking physician-prescribed  calcium supplements and vitamin D  • doing stretching exercises to improve balance and flexibility  6. Eating Right During Menopause.Academy of Nutrition  and Dietetics. http:/ /www.eatright.org/Public/ content.aspx?id=6809.

A number of physiological and emotional changes take place  during this life stage. For example, many older adults face serious  health challenges, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or  dementia. Both men and women experience a loss of hormone  production, muscle mass, and strength and undergo changes in  body composition. Fat deposits build up in the abdominal area,  which increases the risk for Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular  disease. The skin becomes thinner and may take longer to heal after  an injury.

Kidneys are not as effective in  excreting metabolic products such as sodium, acid, and potassium,  which can alter water balance and increase the risk for over- or  underhydration. In addition, immune function decreases and there  is lower efficiency in the absorption of vitamins and minerals.  In addition, disorders of the nervous system can have profound  effects. Dementia is the umbrella term for changes in the normal  activity of the brain. Elderly adults who suffer from dementia may  experience memory loss, agitation, and delusions. One in eight  people over age sixty-four and almost half of all people over eighty- five suffer from the brain disorder Alzheimer’s disease, which is  the most common form of dementia.2 Neurological disorder and  psychological conditions, such as depression, can influence  attitudes toward food, along with the ability to prepare or ingest  food. They might lead some adults to overindulge to compensate for  stress or emotions that are difficult to handle. Other adults might  eat less or pay less attention to their diet and nutritional needs.  Older adults may also need guidance from dietitians and health- care professionals to make the best dietary choices for this stage of  life.  Beginning at age fifty-one, requirements change once again and  relate to the nutritional issues and health challenges that older  people face. After age sixty, blood pressure rises and the immune  system may have more difficulty battling invaders and infections.

However, many older adults remain in relatively  good health and continue to be active into their golden years. Good  nutrition is often the key to maintaining health later in life. In  addition, the fitness and nutritional choices made earlier in life set  the stage for continued health and happiness.  Older adults should  continue to consume nutrient-dense foods and remain physically  active. However, deficiencies are more common after age sixty,  primarily due to reduced intake or malabsorption. The loss of  mobility among frail, homebound elderly adults also impacts their  access to healthy, diverse foods.  Energy and Macronutrients  Due to reductions in lean body mass and metabolic rate, older  adults require less energy than younger adults. The energy  requirements for people ages fifty-one and over are 1,600 to 2,200  calories for women and 2,000 to 2,800 calories for men, depending  on activity level. The decrease in physical activity that is typical of  older adults also influences nutritional requirements. The AMDRs  for carbohydrates, protein, and fat remain the same from middle  age into old age. Older adults should substitute more unrefined  carbohydrates for refined ones, such as whole grains and brown  rice. Fiber is especially important in preventing constipation and  diverticulitis, and may also reduce the risk of colon cancer. Protein  3. McMillan, B. (2008).

Micronutrients  An increase in certain micronutrients can help maintain health  during this life stage. The recommendations for calcium increase to  1,200 milligrams per day for both men and women to slow bone loss.  Also to help protect bones, vitamin D recommendations increase  to 10–15 micrograms per day for men and women. Vitamin B6  recommendations rise to 1.7 milligrams per day for older men and  1.5 milligrams per day for older women to help lower levels of  homocysteine and protect against cardiovascular disease. As adults  age, the production of stomach acid can decrease and lead to an  overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine. This can affect the  absorption of vitamin B12 and cause a deficiency. As a result, older  adults need more B12 than younger adults, and require an intake  of 2.4 micrograms per day, which helps promote healthy brain  functioning. For elderly women, higher iron levels are no longer  needed postmenopause and recommendations decrease to 8  milligrams per day. People over age fifty should eat foods rich with  all of these micronutrients.  Nutritional Concerns for Older Adults  Dietary choices can help improve health during this life stage and  address some of the nutritional concerns that many older adults  face. In addition, there are specific concerns related to nutrition  that affect adults in their later years. They include medical  problems, such as disability and disease, which can impact diet and  922  |  Older Adulthood: The Golden Years\n",
            "activity level. For example, dental problems can lead to difficulties  with chewing and swallowing, which in turn can make it hard to  maintain a healthy diet. The use of dentures or the preparation of  pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also  is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have  a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to  dehydration.  Sensory Issues  At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number.  As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning  that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste.  Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty,  sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less  appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in  sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those  tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes  toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because  the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of  digestive enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.  Dysphagia  Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition  because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to  swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control  swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common  cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia  because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults  suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency.  Older Adulthood: The Golden Years  |  923\n",
            "For example, solid foods can be pureed, ground, or chopped to  allow more successful and safe swallow. This decreases the risk  of aspiration, which occurs when food flows into the respiratory  tract and can result in pneumonia. Typically, speech therapists,  physicians, and dietitians work together to determine the  appropriate diet for dysphagia patients.  Obesity in Old Age  Similar to other life stages, obesity is a concern for the elderly.  Adults over age sixty are more likely to be obese than young or  middle-aged adults. As explained throughout this chapter, excess  body weight has severe consequences. Being overweight or obese  increases the risk for potentially fatal conditions that can afflict the  elderly. They include cardiovascular disease, which is the leading  cause of death in the United States, and Type 2 diabetes, which  causes about seventy thousand deaths in the United States  annually.4 Obesity is also a contributing factor for a number of other  conditions, including arthritis.  For older adults who are overweight or obese, dietary changes to  promote weight loss should be combined with an exercise program  to protect muscle mass. This is because dieting reduces muscle as  well as fat, which can exacerbate the loss of muscle mass due to  aging. Although weight loss among the elderly can be beneficial, it  is best to be cautious and consult with a healthcare professional  before beginning a weight-loss program.  4. Deaths and Mortality.

            "The Anorexia of Aging  In addition to concerns about obesity among senior citizens, being  underweight can be a major problem. A condition known as the  anorexia of aging is characterized by poor food intake, which results  in dangerous weight loss. This major health problem among the  elderly leads to a higher risk for immune deficiency, frequent falls,  muscle loss, and cognitive deficits. Reduced muscle mass and  physical activity mean that older adults need fewer calories per  day to maintain a normal weight. It is important for health care  providers to examine the causes for anorexia of aging among their  patients, which can vary from one individual to another.  Understanding why some elderly people eat less as they age can  help healthcare professionals assess the risk factors associated with  this condition. Decreased intake may be due to disability or the lack  of a motivation to eat. Also, many older adults skip at least one meal  each day. As a result, some elderly people are unable to meet even  reduced energy needs.  Nutritional interventions should focus primarily on a healthy diet.  Remedies can include increasing the frequency of meals and adding  healthy, high-calorie foods (such as nuts, potatoes, whole-grain  pasta, and avocados) to the diet. Liquid supplements between meals  may help to improve caloric intake.5 Health care professionals  should consider a patient’s habits and preferences when developing  a nutritional treatment plan. After a plan is in place, patients should  be weighed on a weekly basis until they show improvement.  5. Morley, JE. (1997). Anorexia of Aging: Physiologic and  Pathologic.

            "Vision Problems  Many older people suffer from vision problems and a loss of vision.  Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness  in Americans over age sixty.6 This disorder can make food planning  and preparation extremely difficult and people who suffer from  it often must depend on caregivers for their meals. Self-feeding  also may be difficult if an elderly person cannot see his or her  food clearly. Friends and family members can help older adults with  shopping and cooking. Food-assistance programs for older adults  (such as Meals on Wheels) can also be helpful.  Diet may help to prevent macular degeneration. Consuming  colorful fruits and vegetables increases the intake of lutein and  zeaxanthin. Several studies have shown that these antioxidants  provide protection for the eyes. Lutein and zeaxanthin are found in  green, leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, and collard greens, and  also corn, peaches, squash, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, orange juice,  and honeydew melon.7  Longevity and Nutrition  The foods you consume in your younger years influence your health  as you age.

The  right foods provide numerous benefits at every stage of life. They  help an infant grow, an adolescent develop mentally and physically,  a young adult achieve his or her physical peak, and an older adult  cope with aging. Nutritious foods form the foundation of a healthy  life at every age.  Developing Habits  Eating habits develop early in life. They are typically formed within  the first few years and it is believed that they persist for years, if  not for life. So it is important for parents and other caregivers to  help children establish healthy habits and avoid problematic ones.  Children begin expressing their preferences at an early age. Parents  must find a balance between providing a child with an opportunity  for self-expression, helping a child develop healthy habits, and  making sure that a child meets all of their nutritional needs.  Bad habits and poor nutrition have an accrual effect. The foods  you consume in your younger years will impact your health as you  age, from childhood into the later stages of life. As a result, good  nutrition today means optimal health tomorrow. Therefore, it is best  to start making healthy choices from a young age and maintain them  as you mature. However, a recent report published in the American  Journal of Clinical Nutrition, suggests that adopting good nutritional  choices later in life, during the forties, fifties, and even the sixties,  may still help to reduce the risk of chronic disease as you grow  older.8  8. Rivlin, RS.

For example, a decrease in body  strength can result in an increased risk for fractures because older  adults with weakened muscles are more likely to fall, and to sustain  serious injuries when they do. However, improving your diet while  increasing physical activity helps to control weight, reduce fat mass,  and maintain muscle and bone mass.  There are a number of changes middle-aged adults can  implement, even after years of unhealthy choices. Choices include  eating more dark, green, leafy vegetables, substituting high-fat  proteins with lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and nuts, and  engaging in moderate physical activity for thirty minutes per day,  several days per week. The resulting improvements in body  composition will go a long way toward providing greater protection  against falls and fractures, and helping to ward off cardiovascular  disease and hypertension, among other chronic conditions.9  It Too Late to Improve Our Health through Nutrition?.

A well-rounded exercise program is crucial to  becoming and remaining healthy. Physical activity improves your  health in a number of ways. It promotes weight loss, strengthens  muscles and bones, keeps the heart and lungs strong, and helps to  protect against chronic disease. There are four essential elements  of physical fitness: cardiorespiratory, muscular strength, flexibility,  and maintaining a healthful body composition. Some enthusiasts  might argue the relative importance of each, but optimal health  requires some degree of balance between all four. For example,  the Hawai‘i Ironman is a vigorous race that consists of a 2.4 mile  swim, 112 mile bike, and a 26 mile run. All four elements of physical  fitness are vital in order to complete each leg of the race. To learn  more  about  the  Hawai‘i  Ironman,  visit  their  website  at  http:/ /www.ironman.com.  Some forms of exercise confer multiple benefits, which can help  you to balance the different elements of physical fitness. For  example, riding a bicycle for thirty minutes or more not only builds  cardiorespiratory endurance, it also improves muscle strength and  muscle endurance. Some forms of yoga can also build muscle  strength and endurance, along with flexibility. However, addressing  fitness standards in all four categories generally requires  incorporating a range of activities into your regular routine. If you  exercise regularly, your body will begin to change and you will  notice that you are able to continue your activity longer. This is  934  |  Introduction\n",

Building cardiorespiratory endurance  through aerobic exercise is an excellent way to maintain a healthy  weight. Working on this element of physical fitness also improves  your circulatory system. It boosts your ability to supply the body’s  cells with oxygen and nutrients, and to remove carbon dioxide and  metabolic waste. Aerobic exercise is continuous exercise (lasting  more than 2 minutes) that can range from low to high levels of  intensity. In addition, aerobic exercise increases heart and  breathing rates to meet increased demands for oxygen in working  muscles. Regular, moderate aerobic activity, about thirty minutes at  a time for five days per week, trains the body to deliver oxygen more  efficiently, which strengthens the heart and lungs, and reduces the  risk of cardiovascular disease.1 Strengthening your heart muscle  1. The American Heart Association Recommendations for  Physical Activity in Adults.

Aerobic exercise  increases the ability of muscles to use oxygen for energy  metabolism therefore creating ATP.  Aerobic capacity, or VO2 is the most common standard for  evaluating cardiorespiratory endurance. VO2 max is your maximal  oxygen uptake, and the VO2 max test measures the amount of  oxygen (in relation to body weight) that you can use per minute. A  test subject usually walks or runs on a treadmill or rides a stationary  bicycle while the volume and oxygen content of exhaled air is  measured to determine oxygen consumption as exercise intensity  increases. At some point, the amount of oxygen consumed no longer  increases despite an increase in exercise intensity. This value of  oxygen consumption is referred to as VO2 max, ‘V’ meaning volume,  and ‘max’ meaning the maximum amount of oxygen (O2) an  individual is capable of utilizing. The higher the number, the more  oxygen you can consume, and the faster or longer you can walk, run,  bike, or swim, among other aerobic activities. VO2 max can increase  over time with training.2  Figure 16.1 VO2 Max Test  Physical-Activity- Infographic_UCM_450754_SubHomePage.jsp. Accessed  March 10, 2018.  2. Ed Eyestone.

Anaerobic  exercise consists of short duration, high intensity movements that  rely on immediately available energy sources and require little or  no oxygen during the activity. This type of high intensity training  is used to build muscle strength by short, high intensity activities.  Building muscle mass is not just crucial for athletes and  bodybuilders—building muscle strength and endurance is important  for children, seniors, and everyone in between. The support that  your muscles provide allows you to work, play, and live more  efficiently. Strength training involves the use of resistance  machines, resistance bands, free weights, or other tools. However,  you do not need to pay for a gym membership or expensive  equipment to strengthen your muscles. Homemade weights, such as  plastic bottles filled with sand, can work just as well.

Strength training  can also help you to maintain muscle mass during a weight-loss  program.3  Flexibility  Flexibility is the range of motion available to your joints. Yoga, tai  chi, Pilates, and stretching exercises work to improve this element  of fitness. Stretching not only improves your range of motion, it  also promotes better posture, and helps you perform activities that  can require greater flexibility, such as chores around the house.  In addition to working on flexibility, older adults should include  balance exercises in their regular routine. Balance tends to  deteriorate with age, which can result in falls and fractures.4  Body Composition  Body composition is the proportion of fat and fat-free mass (which  3. American College of Sports Medicine.

A healthy and  physically fit individual has a greater proportion of muscle and  smaller proportion of fat than an unfit individual of the same weight.  Although habitual physical activity can promote a more healthful  body composition, other factors like age, gender, genetics, and diet  contribute to an individual’s body composition. Women have a  higher healthy fat percentage than men. For adult women, a healthy  amount of body fat ranges from 20 to 32 percent. Adult males on the  other hand range from 10 to 22 percent of body fat.5    Metabolic Fitness  Being fit also includes metabolic fitness. It relates to the number  of calories you require to survive and the number of calories you  burn during physical activity. Recall that metabolism is the sum of  all chemical reactions that occur in the human body to conduct life’s  processes. Some are catabolic reactions that break down nutrients  to supply the body with cellular energy. The rate at which a person  burns calories depends on body composition, gender, age,  nutritional status, physical activity, and genetics.  Increasing your daily activity and shedding excess body fat helps  to improve metabolic fitness. Physical activity also makes weight  management easier because it increases energy needs and lean  body mass. During moderate to vigorous activity, energy  expenditure raises well above the resting rate. With continuous  5. Measuring and Evaluating Body Composition.

            "exercise over time, regular exercise increases lean body mass as  well. At rest, lean tissues use more energy than fat tissue therefore  increasing basal metabolism. The combination of increased energy  output, energy expenditure and basal needs over a long period of  time can have a major impact on total energy expenditure (see  Figure 16.2 “The Effect of Physical Activity on Energy Expenditure”).  The more energy you expend, the more foods you are able to  consume while maintaining a healthy weight. Any improvement to  metabolic fitness is beneficial and means a decrease in the risk for  developing diabetes, or other chronic conditions.  One measurement of metabolic fitness is basal metabolic rate, or  BMR, which is a measurement of the amount of energy required for  the body to maintain its basic functions while at rest, i.e. breathing,  heart beats, liver and kidney function, and so on. On average, BMR  accounts for between 50 and 70 percent of a person’s total daily  energy expenditure. Different factors can affect the BMR. For  example, a slender person who is tall has more body surface area  and therefore has a higher RMR relative to their body mass (weight).  Also, muscle utilizes more energy at rest than fat, so a person with  more muscle mass has a higher BMR.  A second measurement of metabolic fitness is the number of  calories burned during physical activity. The amount of calories  burned depends on how much oxygen is delivered to tissues, and  how efficiently metabolic reactions consume oxygen and, therefore,  expend calories. One of the best estimates of energy expenditure  during exercise is how much oxygen a person consumes. Recall that  VO2 max is a measure of the maximum cardiorespiratory capacity  to deliver oxygen to the body, especially to working muscles during  exercise.. Greater VO2 max is indicative of better cardiovascular  fitness. In contrast to RMR, VO2 max increases significantly with  exercise training due to training adaptations that increase the  body’s ability to deliver oxygen to working tissues and an increased  capacity of muscles to take up and utilize oxygen.

It is not necessary  to perform at the level of a professional dancer or athlete, or to work  out for several hours every day, to see real gains from exercise. Even  slightly increased activity can lead to physical benefits, such as:  • Longer life. A regular exercise program can reduce your risk of  dying early from heart disease, certain cancers, and other  leading causes of death.  • Healthier weight. Exercise, along with a healthy, balanced  eating plan, can help you lose extra weight, maintain weight  loss, or prevent excessive weight gain.  • Cardiovascular disease prevention. Being active boosts HDL  cholesterol and decreases unhealthy triglycerides, which  reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases.  • Management of chronic conditions. A regular routine can help  to prevent or manage a wide range of conditions and concerns,  such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, depression,  arthritis, and certain types of cancer.  • Energy boosts. Regular physical activity can improve muscle  tone and strength and provide a boost to your cardiovascular  system. When the heart and lungs work more efficiently, you  have more energy.  • Strong bones.

Aerobic activity, strength-training, and  more contemplative activities such as yoga, all help break  cycles of worry, absorption, and distraction, effectively  draining tension from the body.  • Reduced risk of depression, or limited symptoms of it. Some  people have called exercise “nature’s antidepressant,” and  studies have shown that physical activity reduces the risk of  and helps people cope with the symptoms of depression.  • Cognitive skills retention. Regular physical activity can help  people maintain thinking, learning, and judgement as they age.  • Better sleep.

            "Fuel Sources  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  The human body uses carbohydrate, fat and protein in food and  from body stores as energy. These essential nutrients are needed  regardless of the intensity of activity you are doing. If you are lying  down reading a book or running the the Honolulu Marathon, these  macronutrients are always needed in the body. However, in order  for these nutrients to be used as fuel for the body, their energy must  be transferred into the high energy molecule known as Adenosine  Triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the body’s immediate fuel source of  energy that can be generated either with the presences of oxygen  known as aerobic metabolism or without the presence of oxygen  by anaerobic metabolism. The type of metabolism that is  predominately used during physical activity is determined by the  availability of oxygen and how much carbohydrate, fat, and protein  are used.  Anaerobic and Aerobic Metabolism  Anaerobic metabolism occurs in the cytosol of the muscle cells. As  seen in Figure 16.2 “Anaerobic versus Aerobic Metabolism”, a small  amount of ATP is produced in the cytosol without the presence of  oxygen. Anaerobic metabolism uses glucose as its only source of fuel  and produces pyruvate and lactic acid. Pyruvate can then be used as  fuel for aerobic metabolism. Aerobic metabolism takes place in the  mitochondria of the cell and is able to use carbohydrates, protein or  fat as its fuel source.  Aerobic metabolism is a much slower process  than anaerobic metabolism but produces majority of the ATP.  Figure 16.3  Anaerobic versus Aerobic Metabolism  950  |  Fuel Sources\n",
            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  Physical Activity Duration and Fuel Use  The respiratory system plays a vital role in the uptake and delivery  of oxygen to muscle cells throughout the body. Oxygen is inhaled  by the lungs and transferred from the lungs to the blood where  the cardiovascular system circulates the oxygen-rich blood to the  muscles.  The oxygen is then taken up by the muscles and can be  used to generate ATP. When the body is at rest, the heart and  lungs are able to supply the muscles with adequate amounts of  oxygen to meet the aerobic metabolism energy needs. However,  during physical activity your muscles energy and oxygen needs are  increased. In order to provide more oxygen to the muscle cells, your  heart rate and breathing rate will increase. The amount of oxygen  that is delivered to the tissues via the cardiovascular and respiratory  systems during exercise depend on the duration, intensity and  physical conditioning of the individual.  During the first few steps of exercise, your muscles are the first  to respond to the change in activity level. Your lungs and heart  however do not react as quickly and during those beginning steps  they do not begin to increase the delivery of oxygen. In order for  Fuel Sources  |  951\n",
            "our bodies to get the energy that is needed in these beginning steps,  the muscles rely on a small amount of ATP that is stored in resting  muscles. The stored ATP is able to provide energy for only a few  seconds before it is depleted. Once the stored ATP is just about  used up, the body resorts to another high-energy molecule known  as creatine phosphate to convert ADP (adenosine diphosphate) to  ATP. After about 10 seconds, the stored creatine phosphate in the  muscle cells are also depleted as well.  About 15 seconds into exercise, the stored ATP and creatine  phosphate are used up in the muscles. The heart and lungs have still  not adapted to the increase need of oxygen so the muscles must  begin to produce ATP by anaerobic metabolism (without oxygen).  Anaerobic metabolism can produce ATP at a rapid pace but only  uses glucose as its fuel source. The glucose is obtained from the  blood of muscle glycogen. At around 30 seconds, anaerobic  pathways are operating at their full capacity but because the  availability of glucose is limited, it cannot continue for a long period  of time.  As your exercise reaches two to three minutes, your heart rate  and breathing rate have increased to supply more oxygen to your  muscles. Aerobic metabolism is the most efficient way of producing  ATP by producing 18 times more ATP for each molecule of glucose  than anaerobic metabolism. Although the primary source of ATP in  aerobic metabolism is carbohydrates, fatty acids and protein can  also be used as fuel to generate ATP.  Figure 16.4 The Effect of Exercise Duration on Energy Systems  952  |  Fuel Sources\n",
            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  The fuel sources for anaerobic and aerobic metabolism will change  depending on the amount of nutrients available and the type of  metabolism. Glucose may come from blood glucose (which is from  dietary carbohydrates or liver glycogen and glucose synthesis) or  muscle glycogen. Glucose is the primary energy source for both  anaerobic and aerobic metabolism. Fatty acids are stored as  triglycerides in muscles but about 90% of stored energy is found  in adipose tissue. As low to moderate intensity exercise continues  using aerobic metabolism, fatty acids become the predominant fuel  source for the exercising muscles. Although protein is not  considered a major energy source, small amounts of amino acids  are used while resting or doing an activity.  The amount of amino  acids used for energy metabolism increase if the total energy intake  from your diet does not meet the nutrient needs or if you are  involved in long endurance exercises. When amino acids are broken  down removing the nitrogen-containing amino acid, that remaining  carbon molecule can be broken down into ATP via aerobic  metabolism or used to make glucose. When exercise continues for  many hours, amino acid use will increase as an energy source and  for glucose synthesis.

            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  Physical Activity Intensity and Fuel Use  The exercise intensity determines the contribution of the type of  fuel source used for ATP production(see Figure 16.4 “The Effect of  Exercise Intensity on Fuel Sources”). Both anaerobic and aerobic  metabolism combine during exercise to ensure that the muscles  are equipped with enough ATP to carry out the demands placed on  them. The amount of contribution from each type of metabolism  will depend on the intensity of an activity. When low-intensity  activities are performed, aerobic metabolism is used to supply  enough ATP to muscles. However, during high-intensity activities  more ATP is needed so the muscles must rely on both anaerobic and  aerobic metabolism to meet the body’s demands.  During low-intensity activities, the body will use aerobic  metabolism over anaerobic metabolism because it is more efficient  by producing larger amounts of ATP. Fatty acids are the primary  energy source during low-intensity activity. With fat reserves in  the body being almost unlimited, low-intensity activities are able  to continue for a long time. Along with fatty acids, a small amount  954  |  Fuel Sources\n",
            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  of glucose is used as well. Glucose differs from fatty acids where  glycogen storages can be depleted. As glycogen stores are depleted,  fatigue will eventually set in.  Figure 16.6 The Effect of Exercise Intensity on Fuel Sources  The Fat-Burning Zone  The fat-burning zone is a low intensity aerobic activity  that keeps your heart rate between 60 and 69% of your  maximum heart rate. The cardio zone on the other hand is  a high intensity aerobic activity that keeps the heart rate  between about 70 to 85% of your maximum heart rate. So  which zone do you burn the most fat in? Technically, your  body burns a higher percentage of of calories from fat  during a low intensity aerobic activity but there’s more to it  Fuel Sources  |  955\n",
            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese  / CC BY  4.0  than just that. When you begin a low intensity activity,  about 50% of the calories burned comes from fat whereas  in the cardio zone only 40% come froms fat. However,  when looking at the actual numbers of calories burned,  higher intensity activity burns just as much fat and a much  greater total calories overall.  “Hitting the Wall” or “Bonking”  If you are familiar with endurance sports, you may have heard of  “hitting the wall” or “bonking.” These colloquial terms refer to the  extreme fatigue that sets in after about 120 minutes of performing  an endurance sport, such as marathon running or long-distance  956  |  Fuel Sources\n",
            "cycling. The physiology underlying “hitting the wall” means that  muscles have used up all their stored glycogen and are therefore  dependent on other nutrients to support their energy needs. Fatty  acids are transported from fat-storing cells to the muscle to rectify  the nutrient deficit. However, fatty acids take more time to convert  to energy than glucose, thus decreasing performance levels. To  avoid “hitting the wall” or “bonking,” endurance athletes load up  on carbohydrates for a few days before the event, known as  carbohydrate loading. This will maximize an athlete’s amount of  glycogen stored in their liver and muscle tissues. It is important not  to assume that carbohydrate loading works for everyone. Without  accompanied endurance training you will not increase the amount  of stored glucose. If you plan on running a five-mile race for fun  with your friend and decide to eat a large amount of carbohydrates  in the form of a big spaghetti dinner the night before, the excess  carbohydrates will be stored as fat. Therefore, if you are not an  endurance athlete exercising for more than 90 minutes,  carbohydrate loading will provide no benefit, and can even have  some disadvantages. Another way for athletes to avoid “hitting the  wall” is to consume carbohydrate-containing drinks and foods  during an endurance event. In fact, throughout the Tour de  France—a twenty-two-day, twenty-four-hundred-mile race—the  average cyclist consumes greater than 60 grams of carbohydrates  per hour.

The foods consumed in your diet are used to provide  the body with enough energy to fuel an activity regardless of the  intensity of activity. Athletes have different nutritional needs to  support the vigorous level they compete and practice at.  Energy Needs  To determine an athletes nutritional needs, it is important to revisit  the concept of energy metabolism. Energy intake is the foundation  of an athlete’s diet because it supports optimal body functions,  determines the amount of intake of macronutrients and  micronutrients, and assists in the maintaining of body composition.  Energy needs for athletes increase depending on their energy  expenditure. The energy expended during physical activity are  contingent on the intensity, duration, and frequency of the exercise.  Competitive athletes may need 3,000 to over 5,000 calories daily  compared to a typical inactive individual who needs about 2,000  calories per day. Energy needs are also affected by an individual’s  gender, age, and weight.  Weight-bearing exercises, such as  running, burn more calories per hour than non-weight bearing  exercises, such as swimming. Weight-bearing exercises requires  your body to move against gravity which requires more energy. Men  Sports Nutrition  |  959\n",

Body weight and composition are considered  the focal points of physique for athletes because they are the able  to be manipulated the most. Energy intake can play a role in  manipulating the physiques for athletes. For individuals competing  in sports such as football and weight lifting, having a large amount  of muscle mass and increased body weight may be beneficial. This  can be obtained through a combination of increased energy intake,  and protein. Although certain physiques are more advantageous for  specific sports, it is important to remember that a single and rigid  “optimal” body composition is not recommended for any group of  athletes.2  1. Nutrition and Athletic Performance.

            "Macronutrient Needs  The composition of macronutrients in the diet is a key factor in  maximizing performance for athletes. Carbohydrates are an  important fuel source for the brain and muscle during exercise.   Carbohydrate storage in the liver and muscle cells are relatively  limited and therefore it is important for athletes to consume enough  carbohydrates from their diet. Carbohydrate needs should increase  about 3-10 g/kg/day depending on the type of training or  competition.3 See Table 16.1 “Daily Needs for Carbohydrate Fuel” for  carbohydrate needs for athletes depending on the intensity of the  exercise.

Athletes are recommended to consume the same amount  of fat in the diet as the general population, 20-35% of their energy  intake. Although these recommendations are in accordance with  public health guidelines, athletes should individualize their needs  based on their training level and body composition goals. Athletes  who choose to excessively restrict their fat intake in an effort to lose  body weight or improve body composition should ensure they are  still getting the minimum recommended amount of fat. Fat intakes  below 20% of energy intake will reduce the intake of fat-soluble  vitamins and essential fatty acids, especially omega 3’s. 4  Although protein accounts for only about 5% of energy expended,  dietary protein is necessary to support metabolic reactions (that  generate ATP), and to help muscles with maintenance, growth, and  repair.  During exercise, these metabolic reactions for generating  ATP rely heavily on proteins such as enzymes and transport  proteins. It is recommended that athletes consume 1.2 to 2.0 g/ kg/day of proteins in order to support these functions. Higher  intakes may also be needed for short periods of intense training  4. Nutrition and Athletic Performance. (2016), American  College of Sports Medicine.

            "Common Nutrient Deficiencies for  Athletes  Energy deficiency  For athletes, consuming sufficient amounts of calories to support  their energy expenditure is vital to maintain health and body  functions. When the energy intake for athletes does not meet the  high demands of exercise, a syndrome referred to as relative  deficiency in sport (RED-S) occurs. RED-S has a negative effect on  performance and health in both male and female athletes as shown  in Table 16.7 “Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport Effects”. Athletes in  sports with weight classes, such as wrestling, may put their health at  risk by rapid weight loss in order to hit a specific weight for a match.  These athletes are vulnerable to eating disorders due to sporadic  dieting (several of which will restrict energy intake). The long term  effects of these practices can not only impair performance but also  have serious repercussions such as heart and kidney function,  temperature regulation and electrolyte balance problems.

In today’s society, there is  increasing pressure to be extremely thin that some females take  exercise too far.

Some athletes in intense training may have an increase in iron losses  through sweat, urine, and feces. Iron losses are greater in females  than males due to the iron lost in blood every menstrual cycle.

Dehydration can occur when there  is inadequate water levels in the body and can be very hazardous to  the health of an individual. As the severity of dehydration increases,  the exercise performance of an individual will begin to decline (see  Figure 16.9 “Dehydration Effect on Exercise Performance”). It is  important to continue to consume water before, during and after  exercise to avoid dehydration as much as possible.  Figure 16.9 Dehydration Effect on Exercise Performance  During exercise, thirst is not a reliable short term indicator of the  body’s needs as it typically is not enough to replace the water  loss.

            "exercise, it may not be possible to drink enough water to  compensate for the losses. Dehydration occurs when the total loss  of water is so significant that the total blood volume decreases  which leads to the reduction of oxygen and nutrients transported to  the muscle cells. A decreased blood volume also reduces the blood  flow to the skin and the production of sweat which can increase  the body temperature. As a result, the risk of heat related illnesses  increases.  Heat cramps are one of the heat related illnesses that can occur  during or after exercise. Heat cramps are involuntary muscle  spasms that usually involve the muscle being exercised, which  causes by an imbalance of electrolytes, usually sodium.  Heat  exhaustion is caused the the loss of water decreasing the blood  volume so much that it is not possible to cool the body as well  as provide oxygen and nutrients to the active muscles. Symptoms  that arise from heat exhaustion may include low blood pressure,  disorientation, profuse sweating, and fainting. Heat exhaustion can  progress further if exercise continues into a heat stroke.  A heat  stroke is the most serious form of heat related illnesses that can  occur. During a heat stroke, the internal body temperature rises  above 105℉ which causes the brain’s temperature-regulatory  center to shut down. When the brain’s temperature regulatory  center shuts down, an individual is unable to sweat regardless of  their internal body temperature rising. Other symptoms that arise  are dry skin, extreme confusion, and unconsciousness. A heat stroke  requires immediate medical attention.  The external temperature during exercise can also play a role  in the risk of heat related illnesses.  As the external temperature  increases, it becomes more difficult for the body to dissipate heat.  As humidity also increases, the body is unable to cool itself through  evaporation. The Heat Index is a measure of how hot the body feels  when humidity is added to the air temperature (see Figure 16.10  “The Heat Index”).

Sweat  consists of mostly water but it also causes losses of sodium,  potassium, calcium and magnesium. During most exercises, the  amount of sodium lost is very small.Drinking water after completing  an exercise will replenish the sodium in the body. However, during  long endurance exercises such as a marathon or triathlon, sodium  losses are larger and must be replenished as well. If water is  replenished without sodium the sodium already in the body will  become diluted. These low levels of sodium in the blood will cause  a condition known as hyponatremia (see Figure 16.11 “The Effect  of Exercise on Sodium Levels”). When sodium levels in the blood  are decreased, water moves into the cell through osmosis which  causes swelling. Accumulation of fluid in the lungs and the brain can  cause serious life threatening conditions such as a seizure, coma  and death.

Vitamins, minerals, and other assorted remedies should be  considered as extras. They are add-ons—not replacements—for a  healthy diet. As food naturally contains nutrients in its proper  package, remember that food should always be your primary source  of nutrients. When considering taking supplements, it is important  to recognize possible drawbacks that are specific to each kind:2  • Micronutrient Supplements. Some vitamins and minerals are  toxic at high doses. Therefore, it is vital to adhere to the  Tolerable Upper Intake Levels  (UL) so as not to consume too  much of any vitamin. For example, too much vitamin A is toxic  to the liver. Symptoms of vitamin A toxicity can include  tinnitus (ringing in the ears), blurred vision, hair loss, and skin  rash. Too much niacin can cause a peptic ulcer, hyperglycemia,  dizziness, and gout.  • Herbal Supplements. Some herbs cause side effects, such as  heart palpitations and high blood pressure, and must be taken  very carefully. Also, some herbs have contraindications with  certain medicines. For example, Valerian and St. John’s Wort  negatively interact with certain prescription medications, most  notably antidepressants. Additionally, there is a real risk of  overdosing on herbs because they do not come with warning  labels or package inserts.  2. Choosing a Vitamin and Mineral Supplement—Topic  Overview.

An  occasional amino acid drink in the place of a meal is not a  problem. However, problems may arise if you add the  supplement to your existing diet. Most Americans receive two  to three times the amount of protein required on a daily basis  from their existing diets—taking amino acid supplements just  adds to the excess. Also, certain amino acids share the same  transport systems in the absorption process; therefore, a  concentrated excess of one amino acid obtained from a  supplement may increase the probability of decreased  absorption of another amino acid that uses the same transport  system. This could lead to deficiency in the competing amino  acid.  Supplement Claims and Restrictions  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates supplements,  but it treats them like food rather than pharmaceuticals. Dietary  supplements must meet the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Standards,  but are not required to meet the standards for drugs, although  some companies do so voluntarily. Also, although supplement  manufacturers are allowed to say a particular ingredient may reduce  the risk of a disease or disorder, or that it might specifically target  certain body systems, these claims are not approved by the FDA.  This is why labels that make structural and functional claims are  required to carry a disclaimer saying the product is not intended  “to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” In addition, in the  United States, supplements are taken off the market only after the  Food Supplements and Food Replacements  |  979\n",

Before Taking Supplements  The phrase caveat emptor means “buyer beware,” and it is important  to keep the term in mind when considering supplementation. Just  because a product is “natural” does not mean it can’t be harmful  or dangerous, particularly if used inappropriately. The following are  helpful questions to explore before deciding to take a supplement:  • Does the scientific community understand how this  supplement works and are all its effects well known?  • Is there proof that the supplement actually performs in the  manner that it claims?  • Does this supplement interact with food or medication?  • Is taking this supplement necessary for my health?  • Is the supplement affordable?  • Is the supplement safe and free from contaminants?

Sometimes called  “food poisoning,” foodborne illness is a common public health  problem that can result from exposure to a pathogen or a toxin  via food or beverages. Raw foods, such as seafood, produce, and  meats, can all be contaminated during harvest (or slaughter for  meats), processing, packaging, or during distribution, though meat  and poultry are the most common source of foodborne illness. For  all kinds of food, contamination also can occur during preparation  and cooking in a home kitchen or in a restaurant. For example  in 2009, the Marshall Islands reported 174 cases  presenting with  vomiting and diarrhea. After an epidemiological investigation was  completed, they identified the cause to be egg sandwiches that had  been left at room temperature too long resulting in the growth of  foodborne toxins in the egg sandwiches.1  1. Thein CC, Trinidad RM, Pavlin B.

            "In many developing nations, contaminated water is also a major  source of foodborne illness. Many people are affected by foodborne  illness each year, making food safety a very important issue.  Annually, one out of six Americans becomes sick after consuming  contaminated foods or beverages.2 Foodborne illness can range  from mild stomach upset to severe symptoms, or even fatalities.  The problem of food contamination can not only be dangerous to  your health, it can also be harmful to your wallet. Medical costs  and lost wages due to salmonellosis, just one foodborne disease, are  estimated at over $1 billion per year.  At-Risk Groups  No one is immune from consuming contaminated food but, whether  you become seriously ill depends on the microorganism, the amount  you have consumed, and your overall health. In addition, some  groups have a higher risk than others for developing severe  complications to foodborne disease. Who is most at risk? Young  children, elderly people, and pregnant women all have a higher  chance of becoming very sick after consuming contaminated food.  Other high-risk groups include people with compromised immune  systems due to HIV/AIDS, immunosuppressive medications (such as  after an organ transplant), and long-term steroid use for asthma or  arthritis.

            "The Major Types of  Foodborne Illness  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Foodborne illnesses are either infectious or toxic in nature. The  difference depends on the agent that causes the condition.  Microbes, such as bacteria, cause food infections, while toxins, such  as the kind produced by molds, cause intoxications. Different  diseases manifest in different ways, so signs and symptoms can  vary with the source of contamination. However the illness occurs,  the microbe or toxin enters the body through the gastrointestinal  tract, and as a result common symptoms include diarrhea, nausea,  and abdominal pain. Additional symptoms may include vomiting,  dehydration, lightheadedness, and rapid heartbeat. More severe  complications can include a high fever, diarrhea that lasts more than  three days, prolonged vomiting, bloody stools, and signs of shock.  One of the biggest misconceptions about foodborne illness is that  it is always triggered by the last meal that a person ate. However,  it may take several days or more before the onset of symptoms. If  you develop a foodborne illness, you should rest and drink plenty of  fluids. Avoid antidiarrheal medications, because they could slow the  elimination of the contaminant.  Food Infection  According to the CDC, more than 250 different foodborne diseases  992  |  The Major Types of Foodborne Illness\n",
            "have been identified.1 Majority of these diseases are food infections,  which means they are caused from food contaminated by  microorganisms, such as bacteria, by microscopic animals called  parasites, or by viruses. The infection then grows inside the body  and becomes the source of symptoms. Food infections can be  sporadic and often are not reported to physicians. However,  occasional outbreaks occur that put communities, states and  provinces, or even entire nations at risk. For example, in 1994, an  outbreak of the infection salmonellosis occurred in the United  States due to contaminated ice cream. An estimated 224,000 people  became ill. In 1988, contaminated clams resulted in an outbreak of  hepatitis A in China, which affected about 300,000 people.2  The Reproduction of Microorganisms  Bacteria, one of the most common agents of food infection, are  single-celled microorganisms that are too small to be seen with  the human eye. Microbes live, die, and reproduce, and like all living  creatures, they depend on certain conditions to survive and thrive.  In order to reproduce within food, microorganisms require the  following:  1. Foodborne Illnesses and Germs. (2018).

            "• Temperature. Between 40°F and 140°F, which is called the  danger zone, bacteria grow rapidly.  • Time. More than two hours in the danger zone.  • Water. High moisture content is helpful. Fresh fruits and  vegetables have the highest moisture content.  • Oxygen. Most microorganisms need oxygen to grow and  multiply, but a few are anaerobic and do not.  • Acidity and pH Level. Foods that have a low level of acidity (or a  high pH level) provide an ideal environment, since most  microorganisms grow best around pH 7.0  and not many will  grow below pH 4.0 . Examples of higher pH foods include egg,  meat, seafood, milk, and corn. Examples of low pH foods  include citrus fruits, sauerkraut, tomatoes, and pineapples.  • Nutrient Content. Microorganisms need protein, starch,  sugars, fats, and other compounds to grow. Typically high- protein foods are better for bacterial growth.  Food Intoxication  Other kinds of foodborne illness are food intoxications, which are  caused by natural toxins or harmful chemicals. These and other  unspecified agents are major contributors to episodes of acute  gastroenteritis and other kinds of foodborne illness.3 Like  pathogens, toxins and chemicals can be introduced to food during  cultivation, harvesting, processing, or distribution. Some toxins can  3. Scallan E, Griffin PM, Angulo FJ, et al. (2011). Foodborne  Illness Acquired in the United States—Unspecified  Agents.

            "lead to symptoms that are also common to food infection, such  as abdominal cramping, while others can cause different kinds of  symptoms and complications, some very severe. For example,  mercury, which is sometimes found in fish, can cause neurological  damage in infants and children. Exposure to cadmium can cause  kidney damage, typically in elderly people.

It all begins with the agent that causes  the contamination. When a person ingests a food contaminant, it  travels to the stomach and intestines. There, it can interfere with  the body’s functions and make you sick. In the next part, we will  focus on different types of food contaminants and examine common  microbes, toxins, chemicals, and other substances that can cause  food infections and intoxications. Let’s begin with pathogens, which  include bacteria and viruses. About one hundred years ago, typhoid  fever, tuberculosis, and cholera were common diseases caused by  food  and  water  contaminated  by  pathogens.  Over  time,  improvements in food processing and water treatment eliminated  most of those problems in North America. Today, other bacteria and  viruses have become common causes of food infection.  Bacteria  All foods naturally contain small amounts of bacteria. However, poor  handling and preparation of food, along with improper cooking or  storage can multiply bacteria and cause illness. In addition, bacteria  can multiply quickly when cooked food is left out at room  temperature for more than a few hours. Most bacteria grow  undetected because they do not change the color or texture of food  The Causes of Food Contamination  |  997\n",

The microbes can reactivate when the food is taken out and thawed.  Many different kinds of bacteria can lead to food infections. One of  the most common is Salmonella, which is found in the intestines of  birds, reptiles, and mammals. Salmonella can spread to humans via  a variety of different animal-origin foods, including meats, poultry,  eggs, dairy products, and seafood. The disease it causes,  salmonellosis, typically brings about fever, diarrhea, and abdominal  cramps within twelve to seventy-two hours after eating. Usually, the  illness lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without  treatment. However, in individuals with weakened immune systems,  Salmonella can invade the bloodstream and lead to life-threatening  complications, such as a high fever and severe diarrhea.1  1. Salmonella.

            "The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is found in soft cheeses,  unpasteurized milk, meat, and seafood. It causes a disease called  listeriosis that can bring about fever, headache, nausea, and  vomiting. Listeria monocytogenes mostly affects pregnant women,  newborns, older adults, and people with cancer and compromised  immune systems.  The food infection by Escherichia coli is found in raw or  undercooked meat, raw vegetables, unpasteurized milk, minimally  processed ciders and juices, and contaminated drinking water.  Symptoms can occur a few days after eating, and include watery and  bloody diarrhea, severe stomach cramps, and dehydration. More  severe complications may include colitis, neurological symptoms,  stroke, and hemolytic uremic syndrome. In young children, an E.  coli infection can cause kidney failure and death.  The bacterium Clostridium botulinum causes botulism. Sources  include improperly canned foods, lunch meats, and garlic. An  infected person may experience symptoms within four to thirty- six hours after eating. Symptoms could include nerve dysfunction,  such as double vision, inability to swallow, speech difficulty, and  progressive paralysis of the respiratory system. Botulism can also be  fatal.  Campylobacter jejuni causes the disease campylobacteriosis. It  is the most commonly identified bacterial cause of diarrhea  worldwide. Consuming undercooked chicken, or food contaminated  with the juices of raw chicken, is the most frequent source of this  infection. Other sources include raw meat and unpasteurized milk.  Within two to five days after consumption, symptoms can begin  and include diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever, and bloody stools. The  duration of this disease is about seven to ten days.  The food infection shigellosis is caused by Shigella, of which there  are several types. Sources include undercooked liquid or moist food  Prevention. http:/ /www.cdc.gov/salmonella/.

Another common  symptom is blood, pus, or mucus in stool. Once a person has had  shigellosis, the individual is not likely to get infected with that  specific type again for at least several years. However, they can still  become infected with other types of Shigella.  Staphylococcus aureus causes staphylococcal food poisoning.  Food workers who carry this kind of bacteria and handle food  without washing their hands can cause contamination. Other  sources include meat and poultry, egg products, cream-filled  pastries, tuna, potato and macaroni salad, and foods left  unrefrigerated for long periods of time. Symptoms can begin thirty  minutes to eight hours after eating, and include diarrhea, vomiting,  nausea, stomach pain, and cramps. This food infection usually lasts  one to two days.  Found in raw oysters and other kinds of seafood, Vibrio vulnificus  belongs to the same family as the bacteria which cause cholera. This  food contaminant can result in the Vibrio infection. Symptoms can  begin anywhere from six hours to a few days after consumption,  and include chills, fever, nausea, and vomiting. This disease is very  dangerous and can result in fatalities, especially in people with  underlying health problems.2  2. Foodborne Illnesses and Germs. (2018).

            "Virus  Viruses are another type of pathogen that can lead to food  infections, however they are less predominant than bacteria.  Viruses differ from bacteria in that they cannot grow and reproduce  in foods. Instead, viruses that cause human diseases can only  reproduce inside human cells (see Figure 15.1 “Viruses in the Human  Body”). Hepatitis A is one of the more well-known food- contaminating viruses. Sources include raw shellfish from polluted  water, and food handled by an infected person. This virus can go  undetected for weeks and, on average, symptoms do not appear  until about one month after exposure. At first, symptoms include  malaise, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Three to ten  days later, additional symptoms can manifest, including jaundice  and darkened urine. Severe cases of a hepatitis A can result in liver  damage and death.  The most common form of contamination from handled foods is  the norovirus, which is also known as the Norwalk-like virus, or  the calicivirus. Sources include raw shellfish from polluted water,  salads, sandwiches, and other ready-to-eat foods handled by an  infected person. The norovirus causes gastroenteritis and within  one to three days it leads to symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting,  diarrhea, stomach pain, headache, and a low-grade fever.3  Figure 17.1 Viruses in the Human Body  3. Foodborne Illnesses and Germs.

Several of these creatures  pose major problems to food production worldwide. They include  Anisakis, microscopic worms that invade the stomach or the  intestines. Sources of this parasite include raw fish. This parasite  can result in the Anisakis infection, with symptoms that begin  within a day or less and include abdominal pain, which can be  severe.  Cryptosporidium lives in the intestines of infected animals.  Another common source is drinking water, when heavy rains wash  animal wastes into reservoirs. One major problem with this  pathogen is that it is extremely resistant to disinfection with  chlorine. Cryptosporidium causes the disease cryptosporidiosis,  with symptoms that begin one to twelve days after exposure and  include watery stools, loss of appetite, vomiting, a low-grade fever,  abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. For HIV/AIDS patients and others  with weakened immune systems, the disease can be severe, and  sometimes can lead to death.  1002  |  The Causes of Food Contamination\n",
            "Giardia lamblia is another parasite that is found in contaminated  drinking water. In addition, it lives in the intestinal tracts of animals,  and can wash into surface water and reservoirs, similar to  Cryptosporidium. Giardia causes giardiasis, with symptoms that  include abdominal cramping and diarrhea within one to three days.  Although most people recover within one to two weeks, the disease  can lead to a chronic condition, especially in people with  compromised immune systems.  The  parasite  Toxoplasma  gondii  causes  the  infection  toxoplasmosis, which is a leading cause of death attributed to  foodborne illness in the United States. More than sixty million  Americans carry Toxoplasma gondii, but very few have symptoms.  Typically, the body’s immune system keeps the parasite from  causing disease. Sources include raw or undercooked meat and  unwashed fruits and vegetables. Handling the feces of a cat with an  acute infection can also lead to the disease.4  Mold Toxins  Mold can grow on fruits, vegetables, grains, meats, poultry, and  dairy products, and typically appears as gray or green “fur.”  4. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

No  one knows how many species of fungi exist, but estimates range  from ten- to three-hundred thousand. Unlike single-celled bacteria,  molds are multicellular, and under a microscope look like slender  mushrooms. They have stalks with spores that form at the ends. The  spores give molds their color and can be transported by air, water,  or insects. Spores also enable mold to reproduce. Additionally,  molds have root-like threads that may grow deep into food and  be difficult to see. The threads are very deep when a food shows  heavy mold growth. Foods that contain mold may also have bacteria  growing alongside it.  Some molds, like the kind found in blue cheese, are desirable in  foods, while other molds can be dangerous. The spores of some  molds can cause allergic reactions and respiratory problems. In  the right conditions, a few molds produce mycotoxins, which are  natural, poisonous substances that can make you sick if they are  consumed. Mycotoxins are contained in and around mold threads,  and in some cases, may have spread throughout the food.

Contamination has occurred  in peanuts, tree nuts, and corn. Aflatoxins can cause aflatoxicosis  in humans, livestock, and domestic animals. Symptoms include  vomiting and abdominal pain.

            "Pesticides  Pesticides are important in food production to control diseases,  insects, and other pests. They protect crops and ensure a large  yield. However, synthetic pesticides can leave behind residues,  particularly on produce, that can be harmful to human health. Foods  that contain the highest levels of pesticide residue include  conventionally-grown peaches, apples, bell peppers, celery,  nectarines, strawberries, cherries, pears, spinach, lettuce, and  potatoes. Foods that contain the lowest levels of pesticide residue  include avocados, pineapples, bananas, mangoes, asparagus,  cabbage, and broccoli.7 In many cases, the amount of pesticide  exposure is too small to pose a risk. However, harmful exposures  can lead to certain health problems and complications, including  cancer. Also, infants and young children are more susceptible to  the hazards of pesticides than adults. In addition, using synthetic  pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers contributes to soil and water  pollution and can be hazardous to farm workers.  To protect the public and their workers, many farmers now rely  on alternatives to synthetic pesticide use, including crop rotation,  natural pesticides, and planting non food crops nearby to lure pests  away. Some consumers choose to reduce their exposure to  pesticides by purchasing organic produce. Organic foods are grown  or produced without synthetic pesticides or fertilizer, and all  growers and processors must be certified by the US Department  of Agriculture (USDA).

Chemical runoff from factories can pollute food  products and drinking water. For example, dioxins are chemical  compounds created in industrial processes, such as manufacturing  and bleaching pulp and paper. Fish that swim in dioxin-polluted  waters can contain significant amounts of this pollutant, which  causes cancer. When metals contaminate food, it can result in  serious and even life-threatening health problems. A common metal  contaminant is lead, which can be present in drinking water, soil,  and air. Lead exposure most often affects children, who can suffer  from physical and mental developmental delays as a result.  Methyl mercury occurs naturally in the environment and is also  produced by human activities. Fish can absorb it, and the predatory  fish that consume smaller, contaminated fish can have very high  levels. This highly toxic chemical can cause mercury poisoning,  which leads to developmental problems in children, as well as  autoimmune effects. A condition called Minamata disease was  identified in 1956 in Japan. It was named for the town of Minamata,  which was the site of an environmental disaster when methyl  mercury was released into the surface water near a factory. Many  residents experienced neurological issues, including numbness in  hands and feet, muscle weakness, a narrowing of the field of vision,  damage to hearing and speech, and ataxia, which is a lack of muscle  coordination.8  8. Minamata Disease: The History and Measures.

It also monitors supplements, food labels, claims that  corporations  make  about  the  benefits  of  products,  and  pharmaceutical  drugs.  Sometimes,  the  FDA  must  recall  contaminated foods and remove them from the market to protect  public health. For example, in 2011 contaminated peanut butter led  to the recall of thousands of jars of a few popular brands.2 Recalls  are almost always voluntary and often are requested by companies  after a problem has been discovered. In rare cases, the FDA will  request a recall. But no matter what triggers the removal of a  product, the FDA’s role is to oversee the strategy and assess the  adequacy and effectiveness of the recall.  Many consumers have concerns about safety practices during the  production and distribution of food. This is especially critical given  recent outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. For example, during fall  2011 in the United States, there was an eruption of the bacteria  Listeria monocytogenes in cantaloupe. It was one of the deadliest  outbreaks in over a decade and resulted in a number of deaths and  hospitalizations.3 In January 2011, the Food Safety Modernization  n+in+the+United+States.

The FDA and other agencies also address consumer-related  concerns about protecting the nation’s food supply in the event of a  terrorist attack.  The USDA headed by the Secretary of Agriculture, develops and  executes federal policy on farming and food. This agency supports  farmers and ranchers, protects natural resources, promotes trade,  and seeks to end hunger in the United States and abroad. The USDA  also assures food safety, and in particular oversees the regulation  of meat, poultry, and processed egg products. The CDC tracks  outbreaks, identifies the causes of food infection and intoxication,  and recommends ways to prevent foodborne illness. Other  government agencies that play a role in protecting the public  include the Food Safety and Inspection Service, a division of the  USDA, which enforces laws regulating meat and poultry safety. The  Agricultural Research Service, which is the research arm of the  USDA, investigates a number of agricultural practices, including  those related to animal and crop safety. The National Institute of  Food and Agriculture conducts research and education programs on  food safety for farmers and consumers.

Therefore, the Food Quality Protection Act, which  was passed in 1996, requires manufacturers to show that pesticide  levels are safe for children.  Efforts within the Food Industry  The Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a program  within the food industry designed to promote food safety and  prevent contamination by identifying all areas in food production  and retail where contamination could occur. Companies and  retailers determine the points during processing, packaging,  shipping, or shelving where potential contamination may occur..  Those companies or retailers must then establish critical control  points to prevent, control, or eliminate the potential for food  contamination. The USDA requires the food industry to follow  HACCP for meat and poultry, while the FDA requires it for seafood,  low-acid canned-food, and juice. HACCP is voluntary for all other  food products but its main goal is to prevent contamination at all  costs.  Everyday Connection  The Seven Steps to HACCP:  1.  Conduct a hazard analysis: The manufacturer must  first determine any food safety hazards (ex. biological,  chemicals, or physical) and identify preventative  1014  |  Protecting the Public Health\n",
            "measures to control the hazards.  2.  Identify the critical control points: Critical control  point (CCP) is a point or procedure in food  manufacturing where control can be applied to  prevent or eliminate food hazards that may cause the  food to be unsafe.  3.  Establish critical limits: A critical limit is the  maximum or minimum value that a food hazard must  be controlled at a CCP to prevent, eliminate or reduce  it to an acceptable level.  4.  Establish monitoring requirements: The  manufacture must establish procedures to monitor  the control points to ensure the process is under  control and not above the CCP.  5.  Establish corrective actions: Corrective actions are  needed when monitoring indicates a deviation from  the established critical limit to ensure that no  produce injurious to health has occurred as a result  of the deviation.  6.  Establish verification procedures: Verification  ensures that the HACCP plan is adequate with CCP  records, critical limits and microbial sampling and  analysis.  7.  Record keeping procedure: The manufacturer must  maintain certain documents including its hazard  analysis, HACCP plan, and records monitoring the  CCP, critical limits, and the verification of handling  processed deviations.

            "Food Preservation  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Food preservation protects consumers from harmful or toxic food.  There are different ways to preserve food. Some are ancient  methods that have been practiced for generations, such as curing,  smoking, pickling, salting, fermenting, canning, and preserving fruit  in the form of jam. Others include the use of modern techniques and  technology, including drying, vacuum packing, pasteurization, and  freezing and refrigeration. Preservation guards against foodborne  illnesses, and also protects the flavor, color, moisture content, or  nutritive value of food.  Food Irradiation: What You Need to Know  Irradiation  does  not  make  foods  radioactive,  compromise  nutritional quality, or noticeably change the taste, texture, or  appearance of food. In fact, any changes made by irradiation are so  minimal that it is not easy to tell if a food has been irradiated.  Food irradiation (the application of ionizing radiation to food) is  a technology that improves the safety and extends the shelf life  of foods by reducing or eliminating microorganisms and insects.  Like pasteurizing milk and canning fruits and vegetables, irradiation  can make food safer for the consumer. The Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) is responsible for regulating the sources of  radiation that are used to irradiate food. The FDA approves a source  of radiation for use on foods only after it has determined that  irradiating the food is safe.  Food Preservation  |  1019\n",
            "Why Irradiate Food?  Irradiation can serve many purposes.  • Prevention of Foodborne Illness – to effectively eliminate  organisms that cause foodborne illness, such as Salmonella and  E. coli.  • Preservation – to destroy or inactivate organisms that cause  spoilage and decomposition and extend the shelf life of foods.  • Control of Insects – to destroy insects in or on tropical fruits  imported into the United States. Irradiation also decreases the  need for other pest-control practices that may harm the fruit.  • Delay of Sprouting and Ripening – to inhibit sprouting (e.g.,  potatoes) and delay ripening of fruit to increase longevity.  • Sterilization – irradiation can be used to sterilize foods, which  can then be stored for years without refrigeration. Sterilized  foods are useful in hospitals for patients with severely impaired  immune systems, such as patients with AIDS or undergoing  chemotherapy. Foods that are sterilized by irradiation are  exposed to substantially higher levels of treatment than those  approved for general use.  How Is Food Irradiated?  There are three sources of radiation approved for use on foods.  • Gamma rays are emitted from radioactive forms of the element  cobalt (Cobalt 60) or of the element cesium (Cesium 137).  Gamma radiation is used routinely to sterilize medical, dental,  and household products and is also used for the radiation  treatment of cancer.  • X-rays are produced by reflecting a high-energy stream of  1020  |  Food Preservation\n",
            "electrons off a target substance (usually one of the heavy  metals) into food. X-rays are also widely used in medicine and  industry to produce images of internal structures.  • Electron beam (or e-beam) is similar to X-rays and is a stream  of high-energy electrons propelled from an electron  accelerator into food.  Is Irradiated Food Safe to Eat?  The FDA has evaluated the safety of irradiated food for more than  30 years and has found the process to be safe. The World Health  Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)  have also endorsed the safety of irradiated food.  The FDA has approved a variety of foods for irradiation in the  United States including:  • Beef and Pork  • Crustaceans (e.g., lobster, shrimp, and crab)  • Fresh Fruits and Vegetables  • Lettuce and Spinach  • Poultry  • Seeds for Sprouting (e.g., for alfalfa sprouts)  • Shell Eggs  • Shellfish – Molluscan (e.g., oysters, clams, mussels, and  scallops)  • Spices and Seasonings    Food Preservation  |  1021\n",
            "Image by  USDA / CC  BY 4.0  How Will I Know if My Food Has Been  Irradiated?  The FDA requires that irradiated foods bear the international  symbol for irradiation. Look for the Radura symbol along with the  statement “Treated with radiation” or “Treated by irradiation” on  the food label. Bulk foods, such as fruits and vegetables, are required  to be individually labeled or to have a label next to the sale  container. The FDA does not require that individual ingredients in  multi-ingredient foods (e.g., spices) be labeled. It is important to  remember that irradiation is not a replacement for proper food  handling practices by producers, processors, and consumers.  Irradiated foods need to be stored, handled, and cooked in the  same way as non-irradiated foods, because they could still become  contaminated with disease-causing organisms after irradiation if  the rules of basic food safety are not followed.1  1. Food Irradiation.

Also, food processing protects the health of the consumer and  allows for easier shipment and the marketing of foods by  corporations. However, there are certain drawbacks. Food  processing can reduce the nutritional content of raw ingredients.  For example, canning involves the use of heat, which destroys the  vitamin C in canned fruit. Also, certain food additives that are  included during processing, such as high fructose corn syrup, can  affect the health of a consumer. However, the level of added sugar  can make a major difference. Small amounts of added sugar and  other sweeteners, about 6 to 9 teaspoons a day or less, are not  considered harmful.1  Food Additives  If you examine the label for a processed food product, it is not  unusual to see a long list of added materials. These natural or  synthetic substances are food additives and there are more than  three hundred used during food processing today.

            "The Pros and Cons of Food Additives  The FDA works to protect the public from potentially dangerous  additives. Passed in 1958, the Food Additives Amendment states that  a manufacturer is responsible for demonstrating the safety of an  additive before it can be approved. The Delaney Clause that was  added to this legislation prohibits the approval of any additive found  to cause cancer in animals or humans. However, most additives  are considered to be “generally recognized as safe,” a status that is  determined by the FDA and referred to as GRAS.  Food additives are typically included in the processing stage to  improve the quality and consistency of a product. Many additives  also make items more “shelf stable,” meaning they will last a lot  longer on store shelves and can generate more profit for store  owners. Additives can also help to prevent spoilage that results from  changes in temperature, damage during distribution, and other  adverse conditions. In addition, food additives can protect  consumers from exposure to rancid products and foodborne  illnesses.  Food  additives  aren’t  always  beneficial,  however.  Some  substances have been associated with certain diseases if consumed  in large amounts. For example, the FDA estimates that sulfites can  cause allergic reactions in 1 percent of the general population and  in 5 percent of asthmatics. Similarly, the additive monosodium  glutamate, which is commonly known as MSG, may cause  headaches, nausea, weakness, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat,  and chest pain in some individuals.3  3. The Issues: Additives.

            "Genetically Modified Foods  Genetically modified foods (also known as GM or GMO foods), are  plants or animals that have undergone some form of genetic  engineering. In the United States, much of the soybean, corn, and  canola crop is genetically modified. The process involves the  alteration of an organism’s DNA, which allows farmers to cultivate  plants with desirable characteristics.2 For example, scientists could  extract a gene that produces a chemical with antifreeze properties  from a fish that lives in an arctic region (such as a flounder). They  could then splice that gene into a completely different species, such  as a tomato, to make it resistant to frost, which would enable farms  to grow that crop year-round.3  Certain modifications can be beneficial in resisting pests or  pesticides, improving the ripening process, increasing the  nutritional content of food, or providing resistance to common  viruses. Although genetic engineering has improved productivity  for farmers, it has also stirred up debate about consumer safety  and environmental protection.

There is also some  concern related to the possible transfer of the genes used to create  genetically engineered foods from plants to people. This could  influence human health if antibiotic-resistant genes are transferred  to the consumer. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO)  and other groups have encouraged the use of genetic engineering  without antibiotic-resistance genes. Genetically modified plants  may adversely affect the environment as well and could lead to the  contamination of non-genetically engineered organisms.4  Genetically modified foods fall under the purview of the EPA,  the USDA, and the FDA. Each agency has different responsibilities  and concerns in the regulation of GM crops. The EPA ensures that  pesticides used for GM plants are safe for the environment. The  USDA makes sure genetically engineered seeds are safe for  cultivation prior to planting. The FDA determines if foods made  from GM plants are safe to eat.

Although you can often detect when mold  is present, you can’t see, smell, or taste bacteria or other agents  of foodborne disease. Therefore, it is crucial to take measures to  protect yourself from disease. The four most important steps for  handling, preparing, and serving food are1:  • Clean. Wash hands thoroughly. Clean surfaces often and wash  utensils after each use. Wash fruits and vegetables (even if you  plan to peel them).  • Separate. Don’t cross-contaminate food during preparation  and storage. Use separate cutting boards for produce and for  meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs. Store food products  separately in the refrigerator.  • Cook. Heat food to proper temperatures. Use a food  thermometer to check the temperature of food while it is  cooking. Keep food hot after it has been cooked.  • Chill. Refrigerate any leftovers within two hours. Never thaw  or marinate food on the counter.  Know when to keep food and when to throw it out. It can be helpful  1. US Department of Health and Human Services. “Keep  Food Safe.” Food Safety.gov.

Buying Food  It is best to buy your food from reputable grocers with clean,  sanitary facilities, that keep products at appropriate temperatures.  Consumers should examine food carefully before they purchase it.  It is important to look at food in glass jars, check the stems on  fresh produce, and avoid bruised fruit. Do not buy canned goods  with dents or bulges, which are at risk for contamination with  Clostridium botulinum. Fresh meat and poultry are usually free from  mold, but cured and cooked meats should be examined carefully.  Also, avoid torn, crushed, or open food packages, and do not buy  food with frost or ice crystals, which indicates that the product has  been stored for a long time, or thawed and refrozen. It is also a good  idea to keep meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs separate from other  items in your shopping cart as you move through the grocery store.  Storing Food  Refrigerate perishable foods quickly; they should not be left out  for more than two hours. The refrigerator should be kept at 40°F  (or 4°C) or colder, and checked periodically with a thermometer.  Store eggs in a carton on a shelf in the refrigerator, and not on  the refrigerator door where the temperature is warmest. Wrap meat  packages tightly and store them at the bottom of the refrigerator,  so juices won’t leak out onto other foods. Raw meat, poultry, and  seafood should be kept in a refrigerator for only two days.  Otherwise, they should be stored in the freezer, which should be  Efforts on the Consumer Level: What You Can Do  |  1035\n",

Empty cans of perishable foods or beverages  that have been opened into containers, and promptly place them in  a refrigerator. Also, be sure to consume leftovers within three to five  days, so mold does not have a chance to grow.  Preparing Food  Wash hands thoroughly with warm, soapy water for at least twenty  seconds before preparing food and every time after handling raw  foods. Washing hands is important for many reasons. One is to  prevent cross-contamination between foods. Also, some pathogens  can be passed from person to person, so hand washing can help  to prevent this. Fresh fruits and vegetables should also be rinsed  thoroughly under running water to clean off pesticide residue2.  This is particularly important for produce that contains a high  level of residue, such as apples, pears, spinach, and potatoes.  Washing also removes most dirt and bacteria from the surface of  produce.  Other tips to keep foods safe during preparation include  defrosting meat, poultry, and seafood in the refrigerator,  microwave, or in a water-tight plastic bag submerged in cold water.  Never defrost at room temperature because that is an ideal  temperature for bacteria to grow. Also, marinate foods in the  2. California Department of Pesticide Regulation.  “Pesticides and Food: How We Test for Safety.” Pesticide  Info: What You Should Know about Pesticides, no.  #E09/REV.

Another way to sanitize cutting boards is to rinse  them with a solution of 5 milliliters (1 teaspoon) chlorine bleach  to about 1 liter (1 quart) of water. If possible, use separate cutting  boards for fresh produce and for raw meat. Also, wash the top  before opening canned foods to prevent dirt from coming into  contact with food.  Cooking Food  Cooked food is safe to eat only after it has been heated to an internal  temperature that is high enough to kill bacteria. You cannot judge  the state of “cooked” by color and texture alone. Instead, use a  food thermometer to be sure. The appropriate minimum cooking  temperature varies depending on the type of food. Seafood should  be cooked to an internal temperature of 145°F, beef, lamb, and pork  to 160°F, ground chicken and turkey to 165°F, poultry breasts to  165°F, and whole poultry and thighs to 180°F. When microwaving,  rotate the dish and stir contents several times to ensure even  cooking.  Serving Food  After food has been cooked, the possibility of bacterial growth  increases as the temperature drops. So, food should be kept above  the safe temperature of 140°F, using a heat source such as a chafing  dish, warming tray, or slow cooker. Cold foods should be kept at  40°F or lower. When serving food, keep it covered to block exposure  Efforts on the Consumer Level: What You Can Do  |  1037\n",
            "to any mold spores hanging in the air. Use plastic wrap to cover  foods that you want to remain moist, such as fresh fruits, vegetables,  and salads. After a meal, do not keep leftovers at room temperature  for more than two hours. They should be refrigerated as promptly  as possible. It is also helpful to date leftovers, so they can be used  within a safe time, which is generally three to five days when stored  in a refrigerator.

Each is influenced by the traditions of the past, along  with the produce and livestock available. Traditional diets around  the globe, such as for Native Hawaiians, were comprised of foods  low in fats like fresh fish, and high in complex carbohydrates such  as kalo (taro) and ‘ulu (breadfruit). However, with modernization  and the influence from other ethnic groups that have migrated  to the Hawaiian Island chain, the diet has transitioned to be high  in animal fat, processed meats, and simple carbohydrates. These  changes have played a role in the shift in health issues that many  Native Hawaiians are facing today.

Good nutrition equates to receiving enough (but not too much)  of the macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and water) and  micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) so that the body can stay  healthy, grow properly, and work effectively.

However, a growing understanding of the complexity and potential  of the human condition has prompted a new way of thinking about  health. Today, we focus on the idea of wellness, which involves a  great deal more than just not being sick. Wellness is a state of  optimal well-being that enables an individual to maximize their  potential. This concept includes a host of dimensions—physical,  mental, emotional, social, environmental, and spiritual—which affect  one’s quality of life.1 Striving for wellness begins with an  examination of dietary choices.  Dietary Food Trends  Hundreds of years ago, when food was less accessible and daily life  required much more physical activity, people worried less about  1. Understanding Wellness.

In today’s  industrialized nations, conveniences have solved some problems  and introduced new ones, including the hand-in-hand obesity and  diabetes epidemics. Fad diets gained popularity as more North  Americans struggled with excess pounds. However, new evidence- based approaches that emphasize more holistic measures are on  the rise. These new dietary trends encourage those seeking to lose  weight to eat healthy, whole foods first, while adopting a more  active lifestyle. These sound practices put dietary choices in the  context of wellness and a healthier approach to life.  Everyday Connections  In the past, people’s culture and location determined the  foods they ate and the manner in which they prepared their  meals. For example, in Hawai‘i, taro was a staple complex  carbohydrate that could be eaten in various ways such as  poi and pa‘ia‘i. Today, most people have access to a wide  variety of food and can prepare them any way they choose.  However, customs and traditions still strongly influence  diet and cuisine in most areas of the world.

This trend is giving rise to the idea of functional foods,  Comparing Diets  |  1047\n",
            "which not only help meet basic nutritional needs but also are  reported to fight illness and aging. According to the Academy of  Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), formerly known as the The American   Dietetic Association, functional foods may reduce the risk of  disease or promote optimal health. The AND recognizes four types  of functional foods. They are: conventional foods, modified foods,  medical foods, and special dietary use foods.2  The first group, conventional foods, represents the simplest form  of functional foods. They are whole foods that have not been  modified. Examples include whole fruits and vegetables (which are  abundant in phytochemicals and antioxidants), yogurt and kefir  (which contain natural probiotic bacteria that can help maintain  digestive system health), and moderate amounts of dark chocolate,  made with 70% or more cacao (which contains antioxidants).  Modified foods have been fortified, enriched, or enhanced with  additional nutrients or bioactive compounds. Foods are modified  using biotechnology to improve their nutritional value and health  attributes. Examples of modified foods include calcium-fortified  orange juice, breads enriched with B vitamins, iodized salt, cereals  fortified with vitamins and minerals, margarine enhanced with plant  sterols, and energy drinks that have been enriched with herbs  (ginseng or guarana) or amino acids (taurine). It is important to  consider that the health claims of some modified foods may be  debatable, or entirely fraudulent. Check with a health professional  regarding the effects of modified foods on your health.  Medical foods are designed for enteric administration under the  guidance of a medical professional. (During enteric administration,  food is treated so that it goes through the stomach undigested.  2. Functional Foods.

            "Instead, the food is broken down in the intestines only.) Medical  foods are created to meet very specific nutritional requirements.  Examples of medical foods include liquid formulas for people with  kidney disease, liver disease, diabetes, or other health issues.  Medical food is also given to comatose patients through a  gastronomy tube because they cannot eat by mouth.  Special dietary use foods do not have to be administered under  a doctor’s care and can be found in a variety of stores. Similar to  medical foods, they address special dietary needs and meet the  nutritional requirements of certain health conditions. For example,  a bottled oral supplement administered under medical supervision  is a medical food, but it becomes a special dietary use food when  it is sold to retail customers. Examples of special dietary use foods  include gluten-free foods, lactose-free dairy products, and formulas  and shakes that promote weight loss.  Popular Diets  The concept of functional foods represents initiatives aimed at  addressing health problems. Certain diet plans take this concept  one step further, by striving to prevent or treat specific conditions.  For example, it is widely understood that people with diabetes need  to follow a particular diet. Although some of these diet plans may be  nutritionally sound, use caution because some diets may be fads or  be so extreme that they actually cause health problems.  Before experimenting with a diet, discuss your plans with your  doctor or a registered dietitian. Throughout this section, we will  discuss some of the more popular diets. Some fall under the  category of fad diets, while others are backed by scientific evidence.  Those that fall into the latter category provide a good foundation to  build a solid regimen for optimal health.  Comparing Diets  |  1049\n",
            "The DASH Diet  The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH diet,  focuses on reducing sodium intake to either 2,300 milligrams per  day (as recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans) or  1,500 milligrams per day for certain populations. The DASH diet  is an evidence-based eating plan that can help reduce high blood  pressure. This plan may also decrease the risk of heart attack,  stroke, diabetes, osteoporosis, and certain cancers.3  DASH tips to lower sodium include:  • Using spices instead of salt to add flavor  • Reading sodium content on processed or canned food labels,  and choosing low-sodium options  • Removing some sodium from canned foods (such as beans) by  rinsing the product before consumption  • Avoiding salt when cooking  DASH dieters are recommended to consume a variety of whole  grains and high-fiber fruits and vegetables, and moderate amounts  of low-fat dairy products, lean meats, and heart-healthy fish. In  addition, DASH limits the use of saturated fats to less than 7 percent  of total calories, and limits the consumption of sweets and alcohol.  The DASH diet also calls for consuming less added sugar and  drinking fewer sugar-sweetened drinks. It replaces red meat with  fish and legumes and calls for increased calcium, magnesium,  potassium, and fiber. Also, even though some people on the DASH  diet may find it lowers their HDL (good) cholesterol along with their  3. DASH Diet Eating Plan. DASH Diet Oregon.   http:/ /www.dashdietoregon.org/.

            "LDL (bad) cholesterol, it still has a positive cumulative effect on  heart health.4  The Gluten-Free Diet  The gluten-free diet helps people whose bodies cannot tolerate  gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. One of the most  important ways to treat this condition is to avoid the problematic  foods, which is not easy. Although following a gluten-free diet is  challenging, it is prescribed for patients with gluten intolerance  and celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder with a genetic link.  People who have celiac disease cannot consume gluten products  without damaging their intestinal lining. Eating a gluten-free diet  means finding replacements for bread, cereal, pasta, and more. It  also means emphasizing fresh fruits, vegetables, and other foods  without gluten. However, it is important to note that the gluten- free trend has become something of a fad even for those without a  gluten intolerance. Celiac disease is a relatively rare condition found  in only 1 percent of the population. Therefore, a gluten-free diet  should be followed only with a physician’s recommendation.  Low-Carb Diets  Low-carb diets, which include the Atkins Diet and the South Beach  Diet, focus on limiting carbohydrates—such as grains, fruit, and  starchy vegetables—to promote weight loss. Other low-carb diets  4. DASH Diet Eating Plan. DASH Diet Oregon.  http:/ /www.dashdietoregon.org/. Accessed April 12,  2018.  Comparing Diets  |  1051\n",
            "include the Paleolithic (Paleo) and Ketogenic (Keto) Diet. The Paleo  diet mimics foods that humans consumed during the Stone Age or  the Paleolithic period. This diet promotes higher amounts of grass- fed only animal protein, healthy fats, and non-starchy vegetables  (i.e. okra, bok choy, carrots).5 Similarly, the Keto diet highlights high  protein intake and healthy fats however there is more flexibility  with the source of animal protein and it does not have to be limited  to grass-fed.6 Furthermore, the Paleo diet does not allow for dairy  foods while the Keto diet allows dairy foods without added sugar.  The theory behind the low-carb diet is that insulin prevents the  breakdown of fat by allowing sugar in the form of blood glucose  to be used for energy. Proponents of this approach believe that  because limiting carbohydrates generally lowers insulin levels, it  would then cause the body to burn stored fat instead. They believe  this method not only brings about weight loss, but also reduces the  risk factors for a number of conditions. However, some studies have  shown that people who followed certain low-carb diet plans for two  years lost an average of nearly 9 pounds, which is similar to the  amount of weight lost on higher carbohydrate diets.7  5. Paleolithic Nutrition — A Consideration of Its Nature and  Current Implications | NEJM. https:/ /www-nejm- org.eres.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/doi/full/10.1056/ NEJM198501313120505?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori %3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed.

            "The benefits of this kind of diet include an emphasis on whole,  unprocessed foods and a de-emphasis of refined carbohydrates,  such as white flour, white bread, and white sugar. However, there  are a number of downsides. Typically, the first two weeks allow  for only 20 grams of carbs per day, which can be dangerously low.  In addition, dieters using the low-carb approach tend to consume  twice as many saturated fats as people on a diet high in healthy  carbohydrates. Low-carb diets are also associated with a higher  energy intake, and the notion that “calories don’t count,” which  is prevalent in this kind of diet, is not supported by scientific  evidence.8  The Macrobiotic Diet  The macrobiotic diet is part of a health and wellness regimen based  in Eastern philosophy. It combines certain tenets of Zen Buddhism  with a vegetarian diet and supports a balance of the oppositional  forces of yin and yang. Foods are paired based on their so-called  yin or yang characteristics. Yin foods are thought to be sweet, cold,  and passive, while yang foods are considered to be salty, hot, and  aggressive.  Whole grains make up about 50 percent of the calories consumed  and are believed to have the best balance of yin and yang. Raw  and cooked vegetables comprise about 30 percent of the diet and  include kale, cabbage, collards, bok choy, and broccoli on a daily  8. Steele V.

Additionally, the diet allows small amounts  of fish and seafood several times a week, along with a few servings  of nuts. The macrobiotic diet prohibits certain foods, such as  chocolate, tropical fruits, and animal products, because they are  believed to fall on the far end of the yin-yang spectrum, which  would make it difficult to achieve a Zen-like balance.  The macrobiotic diet focuses on foods that are low in saturated  fats and high in fiber, which can help to lower the risk of  cardiovascular disease. Proponents of this diet also believe that  it may protect against cancer. However, many nutritionists and  healthcare providers express concerns, particularly if the diet is  followed strictly. Extreme macrobiotic eating can be low in protein,  low in calories, and pose a risk for starvation. In addition, the diet is  also very low in essential vitamins and minerals.9  The Mediterranean Diet  The traditional Mediterranean diet incorporates many elements of  the dietary choices of people living in Greece and southern Italy.  The Mediterranean diet focuses on small portions of nutritionally- sound food. This diet features food from plant sources, including  vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, breads and  potatoes, and olive oil. It also limits the consumption of processed  foods and recommends eating locally grown foods rich in  micronutrients and antioxidants. Other aspects of this eating plan  include consuming fish and poultry at least twice per week, eating  9. Zelman, KM. Macrobiotic Diet.  http:/ /www.webmd.com/diet/features/macrobiotic- diet.

            "red meat only a few times per month, having up to seven eggs per  week, and drinking red wine in moderation. Unlike most diets, the  Mediterranean diet does not cut fat consumption across the board.  Instead, it incorporates low-fat cheese and dairy products, and it  substitutes olive oil, canola oil, and other healthy oils for butter and  margarine.  More than fifty years of nutritional and epidemiological research  has shown that people who follow the Mediterranean diet have  some of the lowest rates of chronic disease and the highest rates of  longevity among the populations of the world. Studies have shown  that the Mediterranean diet also helps to decrease excess body  weight, blood pressure, blood fats, and blood sugar and insulin  levels significantly.10  Tools for Change  For six years, researchers from the University of  Bordeaux in France followed the dietary habits of more  than seven thousand individuals age sixty-five and over.  Participants who described greater consumption of extra- virgin olive oil reportedly lowered their risk of suffering a  stroke by 41 percent. The study controlled for stroke risk  factors, such as smoking, alcohol intake, high blood  pressure, and a sedentary lifestyle.

The principle behind raw foodism is that plant foods in  their natural state are the most wholesome for the body. The raw  food diet is not a weight-loss plan, it is a lifestyle choice. People who  practice raw foodism eat only uncooked and unprocessed foods,  emphasizing whole fruits and vegetables. Staples of the raw food  diet include whole grains, beans, dried fruits, seeds and nuts,  seaweed, sprouts, and unprocessed produce. As a result, food  preparation mostly involves peeling, chopping, blending, straining,  and dehydrating fruits and vegetables.  The positive aspects of this eating method include consuming  foods that are high in fiber and nutrients, and low in calories and  saturated fat. However, the raw food diet offers little in the way of  protein, dairy, or fats, which can cause deficiencies of the vitamins  A, D, E, and K. In addition, not all foods are healthier uncooked,  such as spinach and tomatoes. Also, cooking eliminates potentially  11. More Olive Oil in Diet Could Cut Stroke Risk: Study.

Poultry and other  meats should always be cooked before eating.12  Vegetarian and Vegan Diets  Vegetarian and vegan diets have been followed for thousands of  years for different reasons, including as part of a spiritual practice,  to show respect for living things, for health reasons, or because of  environmental concerns. For many people, being a vegetarian is a  logical outgrowth of “thinking green.” A meat-based food system  requires more energy, land, and water resources than a plant-based  food system. This may suggest that the plant-based diet is more  sustainable than the average meat-based diet in the U.S.By avoiding  animal flesh, vegetarians hope to look after their own health and  that of the planet at the same time. Broadly speaking, vegetarians  eat beans, grains, and fruits and vegetables, and do not eat red  meat, poultry, seafood, or any other animal flesh. Some vegetarians,  known as lacto vegetarians, will eat dairy products. Others, known  as lacto-ovo vegetarians, will eat dairy products and eggs. A vegan  diet is the most restrictive vegetarian diet—vegans do not eat dairy,  eggs, or other animal products, and some do not eat honey.  Vegetarian diets have a number of benefits. Well-balanced eating  plans can lower the risk of a number of chronic conditions,  including heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. They also help to  promote sustainable agriculture.

Unbalanced  diets can cause diseases and, conversely, certain illnesses and  diseases can cause an inadequate intake and absorption of  nutrients, simulating the health consequences of an unbalanced  diet. Overeating high-fat foods and nutrient-poor foods can lead  to obesity and exacerbate the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux  disease (GERD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Many diseases  and illnesses, such as celiac disease, interfere with the body getting  its nutritional requirements. A host of other conditions and  illnesses, such as food allergies, cancer, stomach ulcers, Crohn’s  disease, and kidney and liver disease, also can impair the process  of digestion and/or negatively affect nutrient balance and decrease  overall health. Some illnesses that can compromise health are  chronic and persist for a long time, some are communicable and can  be transmitted between people, and some are non-communicable  and are not infectious.  Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease  Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a persistent form of acid  reflux that occurs more than two times per week.

An analysis of several studies  published in the August 2005 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine  concludes that GERD is much more prevalent in people who are  obese.1 The most common GERD symptom is heartburn, but people  with GERD may also experience regurgitation (flow of the stomach’s  acidic contents into the mouth), frequent coughing, and trouble  swallowing.  There are other causative factors of GERD that may be separate  from or intertwined with obesity. The sphincter that separates the  stomach’s internal contents from the esophagus often does not  function properly and acidic gastric contents seep upward.  Sometimes the peristaltic contractions of the esophagus are also  sluggish and compromise the clearance of acidic contents. In  addition to having an unbalanced, high-fat diet, some people with  GERD are sensitive to particular foods—chocolate, garlic, spicy  foods, fried foods, and tomato-based foods—which worsen  symptoms. Drinks containing alcohol or caffeine may also worsen  GERD symptoms. GERD is diagnosed most often by a history of the  frequency of recurring symptoms. A more proper diagnosis can be  made when a doctor inserts a small device into the lower esophagus  that measures the acidity of the contents during one’s daily  activities. About 50 percent of people with GERD have inflamed  tissues in the esophagus.  The first approach to GERD treatment is dietary and lifestyle  modifications. Suggestions are to reduce weight if you are  overweight or obese, avoid foods that worsen GERD symptoms,  1. Hampel H, Abraham NS, El-Serag HB. (2005).

            "eat smaller meals, stop smoking, and remain upright for at least  three hours after a meal. People with GERD may not take in the  nutrients they need because of the pain and discomfort associated  with eating. As a result, GERD can be caused by an unbalanced diet  and its symptoms can lead to a worsening of nutrient inadequacy, a  vicious cycle that further compromises health. Some evidence from  scientific studies indicates that medications used to treat GERD  may accentuate certain nutrient deficiencies, namely zinc and  magnesium. When these treatment approaches do not work surgery  is an option. The most common surgery involves reinforcing the  sphincter that serves as a barrier between the stomach and  esophagus.  Irritable Bowel Syndrome  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by muscle spasms in  the colon that result in abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and/ or diarrhea. Interestingly, IBS produces no permanent structural  damage to the large intestine as often happens to patients who  have Crohn’s disease or inflammatory bowel disease. It is estimated  that one in five Americans displays symptoms of IBS. The disorder  is more prevalent in women than men. Two primary factors that  contribute to IBS are an unbalanced diet and stress.  Symptoms of IBS significantly decrease a person’s quality of life as  they are present for at least twelve consecutive or nonconsecutive  weeks in a year. Large meals and foods high in fat and added sugars,  or those that contain wheat, rye, barley, peppermint, and chocolate  intensify or bring about symptoms of IBS. Additionally, beverages  containing caffeine or alcohol may worsen IBS. Stress and  depression compound the severity and frequency of IBS symptoms.  As with GERD, the first treatment approaches for IBS are diet and  lifestyle modifications. People with IBS are often told to keep a daily  food journal to help identify and eliminate foods that cause the most  1078  |  Nutrition, Health and Disease\n",
            "problems. Other recommendations are to eat slower, add more fiber  to the diet, drink more water, and to exercise. There are some  medications (many of which can be purchased over-the-counter)  to treat IBS and the resulting diarrhea or constipation. Sometimes  antidepressants and drugs to relax the colon are prescribed.  Celiac Disease  Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder affecting between 0.5  and 1.0 percent of Americans—that is, one in every one- to two- hundred people. It is caused by an abnormal immune reaction of  small intestine cells to a type of protein, called gluten. Gluten forms  in the presence of water and is composed of two protein parts,  glutenin and gliadin. Glutenin and gliadin are found in grains that  are commonly used to make bread, such as wheat, rye, and barley.  When bread is made, yeast eats the flour and makes a waste  product, carbon dioxide, which forms bubbles in the dough. As the  dough is kneaded, gluten forms and stretches. The carbon dioxide  gas bubbles infiltrate the stretchy gluten, giving bread its porosity  and tenderness. For those who are sensitive to gluten, it is good  to know that corn, millet, buckwheat, and oats do not contain the  proteins that make gluten. However, some people who have celiac  disease also may have a response to products containing oats. This  is most likely the result of cross-contamination of grains during  harvest, storage, packaging, and processing.  Celiac disease is most common in people of European descent  and is rare in people of African American, Japanese, and Chinese  descent. It is much more prevalent in women and in people with  Type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, and Down and Turner  syndromes. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and can  include pale, fatty, loose stools, gastrointestinal upset, abdominal  pain, weight loss and, in children, a failure to grow and thrive.  The symptoms can appear in infancy or much later in life, even  Nutrition, Health and Disease  |  1079\n",
            "by age seventy. Celiac disease is not always diagnosed because the  symptoms may be mild. A large number of people have what is  referred to as “silent” or “latent” celiac disease.  Celiac disease diagnosis requires a blood test and a biopsy of the  small intestine. Because celiac disease is an autoimmune disease,  antibodies produced by white blood cells circulate in the body and  can be detected in the blood. When gluten-containing foods are  consumed the antibodies attack cells lining the small intestine  leading to a destruction of the small villi projections. This tissue  damage can be detected with a biopsy, a procedure that removes a  portion of tissue from the damaged organ. Villi destruction is what  causes many of the symptoms of celiac disease. The destruction  of the absorptive surface of the small intestine also results in the  malabsorption of nutrients, so that while people with this disease  may eat enough, nutrients do not make it to the bloodstream  because  absorption  is  reduced.  The  effects  of  nutrient  malabsorption are most apparent in children and the elderly as they  are especially susceptible to nutrient deficiencies. Over time these  nutrient deficiencies can cause health problems. Poor absorption  of iron and folic acid can cause anemia, which is a decrease in  red blood cells. Anemia impairs oxygen transport to all cells in the  body. Calcium and vitamin D deficiencies can lead to osteoporosis,  a disease in which bones become brittle.  If you think you or someone close to you may have celiac disease,  do not despair; it is a very treatable disease. Once diagnosed, a  person follows a gluten-free diet for life. This requires dedication  and careful detective work to seek out foods with hidden gluten, but  some stores carry gluten-free foods. After eliminating gluten from  the diet, the tissues of the small intestine rapidly repair themselves  and heal in less than six months.  1080  |  Nutrition, Health and Disease\n",
            "Food Allergies  Paying attention to the way individuals react to various foods is  essential in determining what foods may specifically affect a person  adversely. Food allergies are one of the many ways in which  different body make-ups affect nutritional concerns. Although an  estimated twelve million Americans have food allergies, there are  likely many more people who say they have food allergies than  actually do. This is because food sensitization is different from a  medically-determined food allergy. When someone has a food  allergy, the immune system mistakenly attacks a certain kind of food  (usually the protein component of a food), such as peanuts, as if it  were a threat and IgE antibodies are produced. Doctors sometimes  test for food allergies by using skin-prick tests or blood tests to look  for the presence of IgE antibodies. However, these types of tests  are not always reliable as they can sometimes yield a false positive  result. By far, the most valuable tests for determining a food allergy  is the Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food Challenge (DBPCFC),  which involves administering the food orally and then denoting the  signs and symptoms of the allergic response.  Food allergy symptoms usually develop within a few minutes to  two hours after a person has eaten a food to which they are allergic.  These symptoms can range from the annoying to the potentially  fatal, and include:  • A tingling mouth  • Swelling tongue and/or throat  • Difficulty breathing  • Hives  • Stomach cramps  • Diarrhea  • Vomiting  • Drop in blood pressure  • Loss of consciousness  Nutrition, Health and Disease  |  1081\n",
            "• Death  There are no clear treatments for food allergies. Epinephrine is  sometimes used to control severe reactions, and individuals with  known and dangerous allergies may get prescriptions for self- injectable devices. The only certain way to avoid allergic reactions  to food is to avoid the foods that cause them. Beyond avoidance,  this can mean reading food labels carefully, or even calling  manufacturers for product information.  Ninety percent of food allergies are caused by these eight foods:  1. Milk  2. Eggs  3. Peanuts  4. Tree nuts  5. Fish  6. Shellfish  7. Wheat  8. Soy  The prevalence of food allergies is a complex and growing problem.  In response to this situation, the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious  Diseases  (NIAID)  collaborated  with  thirty-four  professional organizations, federal agencies, and patient-advocacy  groups to develop a comprehensive guide to diagnosing and  managing food allergies and treating acute food allergy reactions.  The guide defines various food allergies, allergens, and reactions,  provides comprehensive information on the prevalence of different  food allergies, tracks the history of food allergies, and reviews  medical management techniques for people with food allergies.  1082  |  Nutrition, Health and Disease\n",
            "Oral Disease  Oral health refers not only to healthy teeth and gums, but also to the  health of all the supporting tissues in the mouth such as ligaments,  nerves, jawbone, chewing muscles, and salivary glands. Over ten  years ago the Surgeon General produced its first report dedicated  to oral health, stating that oral health and health in general are not  separate entities.2  Instead, oral health is an integral part of overall health and well- being. Soft drinks, sports drinks, candies, desserts, and fruit juices  are the main sources of “fermentable sugars” in the American diet.  (Fermentable sugars are those that are easily metabolized by  bacteria in a process known as fermentation. Glucose, fructose,  and maltose are three examples.) Bacteria that inhabit the mouth  metabolize fermentable sugars and starches in refined grains to  acids that erode tooth enamel and deeper bone tissues. The acid  creates holes (cavities) in the teeth that can be extremely painful.  Gums are also damaged by bacteria produced by acids, leading to  gingivitis (characterized by inflamed and bleeding gums). Saliva is  actually a natural mouthwash that neutralizes the acids and aids in  building up teeth that have been damaged.  Figure 18.1 Gingivitis  2. Office of the Surgeon General (US).

However, you will learn that there are many ways to  maximize your bone health at any age.  Osteoporosis is the excessive loss of bone over time. It leads to  decreased bone strength and an increased susceptibility to bone  fracture. The Office of the Surgeon General (OSG) reports that  approximately ten million Americans over age fifty are living with  osteoporosis, and an additional thirty-four million have osteopenia,  which is lower-than-normal bone mineral density.9  8. Park Y, Hunter DJ.

            "Osteoporosis is a debilitating disease that markedly increases the  risks of suffering from bone fractures. A fracture in the hip causes  the most serious consequences—and approximately 20 percent of  senior citizens who have one will die in the year after the injury.  Osteoporosis affects more women than men, but men are also at  risk for developing osteoporosis, especially after the age of seventy.  These  statistics  may  appear  grim,  but  many  organizations—including the National Osteoporosis Foundation and  the OSG—are disseminating information to the public and to health- care professionals on ways to prevent the disease, while at the same  time, science is advancing in the prevention and treatment of this  disease.10  As  previously  discussed,  bones  grow  and  mineralize  predominantly during infancy, childhood, and puberty. During this  time, bone growth exceeds bone loss. By age twenty, bone growth is  fairly complete and only a small amount (about 10 percent) of bone  mass accumulates in the third decade of life. By age thirty, bone  mass is at its greatest in both men and women and then gradually  declines after age forty. Bone mass refers to the total weight of  bone tissue in the human body. The greatest quantity of bone tissue  a person develops during his or her lifetime is called peak bone  mass. The decline in bone mass after age forty occurs because bone  loss is greater than bone growth. The increased bone degradation  decreases the mineral content of bone tissue leading to a decrease  in bone strength and increased fracture risk.  Osteoporosis is referred to as a silent disease, much like high  blood pressure, because symptoms are rarely exhibited. A person  Osteoporosis. 2004.  https:/ /www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ books/NBK45513/.

Detection and treatment of  osteoporosis, before the occurrence of a fracture, can significantly  improve the quality of life. To detect osteopenia or osteoporosis,  BMD must be measured by the DEXA procedure.  During the course of osteoporosis, BMD decreases and the bone  tissue  microarchitecture  is  compromised.  Excessive  bone  resorption in the trabecular tissue increases the size of the holes  in the lattice-like structure making it more porous and weaker. A  disproportionate amount of resorption of the strong cortical bone  causes it to become thinner. The deterioration of one or both types  of bone tissue causes bones to weaken and, consequently, become  more susceptible to fractures. The American Academy of  Orthopaedic Surgeons reports that one in two women and one  in five men older than sixty-five will experience a bone fracture  caused by osteoporosis.11  Figure 18.3 Osteoporosis in Vertebrae  11. Osteoporosis.

The increase in spine curvature not only causes pain,  but also decreases a person’s height. Curvature of the upper spine  produces what is called Dowager’s hump, also known as kyphosis.  Severe upper-spine deformity can compress the chest cavity and  cause difficulty breathing.

Recall that  advanced age and being female increases the likelihood for  developing osteoporosis. These factors present risks that should  signal doctors and individuals to focus more attention on bone  health, especially when the risk factors exist in combination. This is  because not all risk factors for osteoporosis are out of your control.  Risk factors such as age, gender, and race are biological risk factors,  and are based on genetics that cannot be changed. By contrast,  there are other risk factors that can be modified, such as physical  activity, alcohol intake, and diet. The changeable risk factors for  osteoporosis provide a mechanism to improve bone health even  though some people may be genetically predisposed to the disease.    Physical Activity  Bone is a living tissue, like muscle, that reacts to exercise by gaining  Nutrition, Health and Disease  |  1091\n",
            "strength. Physical inactivity lowers peak bone mass, decreases BMD  at all ages, and is linked to an increase in fracture risk, especially in  the elderly. Recall that mechanical stress increases bone remodeling  and leads to increased bone strength and quality. Weight-bearing  exercise puts mechanical stress on bones and therefore increases  bone quality. Weight-bearing exercises such as strength training  with weights, and aerobic weight-bearing activities, such as  walking, running, and stair climbing are the most helpful for  maintaining BMD. Certain aerobic exercises such as biking and  swimming do not build bones, although they are very good for  cardiovascular fitness.The stimulation of new bone growth occurs  when a person participates in weight-bearing or resistance  activities that force the body to work against gravity. Research has  shown that this is an excellent way to activate osteoblasts to build  more new bone. Conversely, physical inactivity lowers peak bone  mass, decreases BMD at all ages, and is linked to an increase in  fracture risk, especially in the elderly.  Being Underweight  Being underweight significantly increases the risk for developing  osteoporosis. This is because people who are underweight often  also have a smaller frame size and therefore have a lower peak bone  mass. Maintaining a normal, healthy weight is important and acts  as a form of weight-bearing exercise for the skeletal system as a  person moves about. Additionally, inadequate nutrition negatively  impacts peak bone mass and BMD. The most striking relationship  between being underweight and bone health is seen in people with  the psychiatric illness anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa is  strongly correlated with low peak bone mass and a low BMD. In  fact, more than 50 percent of men and women who have this illness  1092  |  Nutrition, Health and Disease\n",

Smoking, Alcohol, and Caffeine  Smoking cigarettes has long been connected to a decrease in BMD  and an increased risk for osteoporosis and fractures. However,  because people who smoke are more likely to be physically inactive  and have poor diets, it is difficult to determine whether smoking  itself causes osteoporosis. What is more, smoking is linked to earlier  menopause and therefore the increased risk for developing  osteoporosis among female smokers may also be attributed, at least  in part, to having stopped estrogen production at an earlier age. A  review of several studies, published in the British Medical Journal in  1997, reports that in postmenopausal women who smoked, BMD was  decreased an additional 2 percent for every ten-year increase in age  and that these women had a substantial increase in the incidence of  hip fractures.13  12. Mehler PS, Weiner K.

            "Alcohol intake’s effect on bone health is less clear. In some  studies, excessive alcohol consumption was found to be a risk factor  for developing osteoporosis, but the results of other studies  suggests consuming two drinks per day is actually associated with  an increase in BMD and a decreased risk for developing  osteoporosis. The International Osteoporosis Foundation states  that consuming more than two alcoholic drinks per day is a risk  factor for developing osteoporosis and sustaining a hip fracture in  both men and women.14 Moreover, excessive alcohol intake during  adolescence and young adulthood has a more profound effect on  BMD and osteoporosis risk than drinking too much alcohol later in  life.  Some studies have found that, similar to alcohol intake, excessive  caffeine consumption has been correlated to decreased BMD, but  in other studies moderate caffeine consumption actually improves  BMD. Overall, the evidence that caffeine consumption poses a risk  for developing osteoporosis is scant, especially when calcium intake  is sufficient. Some evidence suggests that carbonated soft drinks  negatively affect BMD and increase fracture risk. Their effects, if  any, on bone health are not attributed to caffeine content or  carbonation. It is probable that any effects of the excessive  consumption of soft drinks, caffeinated or not, on bone health can  be attributed to the displacement of milk as a dietary source of  calcium.  14. New IOF Report Shows Smoking, Alcohol, Being  Underweight, and Poor Nutrition Harm Our Bones.

            "Nutrition  Ensuring adequate nutrition is a key component in maintaining  bone health. Having low dietary intakes of calcium and vitamin D  are strong risk factors for developing osteoporosis. Another key  nutrient for bone health is protein. Remember that the protein  collagen comprises almost one third of bone tissue. A diet  inadequate in protein is a risk factor for osteoporosis. Multiple large  observational studies have shown that diets high in protein increase  BMD and reduce fracture risk and that diets low in protein correlate  to decreased BMD and increased fracture risk. There has been some  debate over whether diets super high in animal protein decreases  bone quality by stimulating bone resorption and increasing calcium  excretion in the urine. A review in the May 2008 issue of the  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concludes that there is more  evidence that diets adequate in protein play a role in maximizing  bone health and there is little consistent evidence that suggests  high protein diets negatively affect bone health when calcium intake  is adequate.15  Osteoporosis Prevention and Treatment  Although the symptoms of osteoporosis do not occur until old age,  osteoporosis is referred to as a childhood disease with old-age  consequences. Thus, preventing osteoporosis in old age begins with  15. Heaney, RP, Layman DK. (2008). Amount and Type of  Protein Influences Bone Health.

They are the leading cause of death worldwide.  Chronic conditions are increasing in frequency. They cause  significant physical and emotional suffering and are an impediment  to economic growth and vitality. It is important, now more than  ever, to understand the different risk factors for chronic disease and  to learn how to prevent their development.  The Risk Factors of Chronic Disease  A risk factor is a signal that your chances for acquiring a chronic  disease may be increased. You might liken a risk factor to the flags  that lifeguards sometimes set up at beaches. When you see these  flags, you know immediately that swimming within the marked  areas could be hazardous, and that if you choose to swim within  these parameters anyway, you are doing so at your own risk. But, if  you heed the warnings, you are taking the necessary step to protect  your safety and health. Similarly, risk factors are warning signs that  coincide with the development and progression of disease.  However, risk factors are not a 100-percent guarantee that a person  will develop a chronic disease, only that the conditions are right.  For example, if a person gets sick with the flu, we can say with  certainty that the illness was caused by a virus. However, we cannot  1098  |  Threats to Health\n",
            "say that a sedentary lifestyle caused the onset of cardiovascular  disease in a patient, because a risk factor indicates a correlation, not  a causation.  Chronic disease usually develops alongside a combination of the  following risk factors: genetics, a prior disease such as obesity or  hypertension, dietary and lifestyle choices, and environmental  problems. Risk factors such as genetics and age cannot be changed.  However, some risk factors can be altered to promote health and  wellness,such as diet. For example, a person who continuously eats  a diet high in sugars, saturated fats, and red meat is at risk for  becoming obese and developing Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular  disease, or several other conditions. Making more healthy dietary  choices can greatly reduce that risk. Being a woman over age sixty- five is a risk factor for developing osteoporosis, but that cannot  be changed. Also, people without a genetic predisposition for a  particular chronic illness can still develop it. Not having a genetic  predisposition for a chronic disease is not a guarantee of immunity.  Identifying Your Risk Factors  To estimate your own risk factors for developing certain chronic  diseases, search through your family’s medical history. What  diseases do you note showing up among close blood relatives? At  your next physical, pay attention to your blood tests and ask the  doctor if any results are out of normal range. It is also helpful to  note your vital signs, particularly your blood pressure and resting  heart rate. In addition, you may wish to keep a food diary to make a  note of the dietary choices that you make on a regular basis and be  aware of foods that are high in saturated fat, among other unhealthy  options. As a general rule, it is important to look for risk factors  that you can modify to promote your health. For example, if you  discover that your grandmother, aunt, and uncle all suffered from  high blood pressure, then you may decide to avoid a high sodium  Threats to Health  |  1099\n",

According to the  National Institutes of Health, over two-thirds of American adults are  overweight, and one in three is obese. Obesity in particular puts  people at risk for a host of complications, including Type 2 diabetes,  heart disease, high cholesterol, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and  some forms of cancer. The more overweight a person is, the greater  his or her risk of developing life-threatening complications. There  is no single cause of obesity and no single way to treat it. However,  a healthy, nutritious diet is generally the first step, including  consuming more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats  and dairy products.1  Cardiovascular Disease  Throughout the remainder of this section, we will examine some  of the more prevalent chronic diseases, their risk factors, and the  choices that can help to discourage their development or  progression.

            "the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease  is the leading cause of death in the United States.2  The disease generally starts with atherosclerosis, or a hardening  of the arteries, a chronic condition so common that most people  show signs of it by the time they turn thirty. Arteries start to narrow  and harden when fats accumulate along their inner walls and form  plaques. A plaque is made of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other  substances found in blood.  Plaque formation causes arteries to narrow and harden, which  elevates blood pressure because the vessels can’t expand effectively  to accommodate blood pulses. Higher blood pressure strains the  heart and causes more damage. Arterial walls can become so  weakened due to high blood pressure that they balloon and form  what is known as an aneurysm. If the aneurysm bursts, it becomes a  life-threatening event. The plaques themselves can also rupture due  to a spike in blood pressure or a tremor along an arterial wall, and  the body responds to this perceived injury by forming blood clots.  These clots are serious health threats, whether they are stationary  (a thrombus) or moving (an embolus). A stable clot can slowly kill off  surrounding tissue, or grow so big that it blocks blood circulation  and causes thrombosis. When a moving clot becomes stuck in an  artery too small for its passage, it cuts off blood flow and causes cell  death. This is referred to as an embolism. Blood clots in heart and  brain arteries can cause heart attacks or strokes.  Table 18.2 The Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease  2. Leading Causes of Death.

Men  have a higher  risk than  women,  though the  risk for  women  steeply rises  after  menopause.  • Family  history. The  more family  members  who have  heart  disease, the  greater the  risk.  • Cigarette smoking. Nicotine constricts blood  vessels, and carbon monoxide damages their  inner lining, which increases the risk of  atherosclerosis.  • Obesity. Excess weight worsens other risk  factors.  • Diabetes. This condition is associated with an  increased risk of heart disease. Both types have  certain risk factors in common, including obesity  and high blood pressure.  • Physical inactivity. Lack of exercise is associated  with heart disease.  • Cholesterol levels. High levels of blood  cholesterol can increase the risk. A high level of  low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or the “bad”  cholesterol, is a common contributing factor.  However, a low level of high-density lipoprotein  (HDL), or “good” cholesterol, can also promote  atherosclerosis.  Steps to Reducing the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease  Diet and nutrition can play a significant role in reducing the risk of  cardiovascular disease. It is helpful to lower sodium intake, increase  consumption of dietary fiber, and limit consumption of saturated  fat, which promotes plaque formation. In addition, it is important  to replace refined starches and added sugar, which can boost  triglycerides, with whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Eating foods  rich in omega-3 fatty acids, especially fish, using alcohol in  moderation, and opting for low or no-fat dairy products can all help  reduce your cardiovascular disease risk.

Hypertension  Chronic high blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a  significant health hazard affecting one out of three adults in the  United States.3 This chronic condition is a major cause of heart  attacks and strokes, yet it has no symptoms until blood pressure  reaches very high levels, which is why it is known as “the silent  killer.” The only way to find out if you have high blood pressure is to  get an accurate reading of your resting blood pressure rate, which  is best done by a medical professional and should be monitored  regularly.  High blood pressure is such an important factor in cardiovascular  disease, that keeping it within a healthy range is vitally important.  Blood pressure readings consist of two numbers. The top number  measures systolic pressure (when the heart contracts) and the  bottom number measures diastolic pressure (when the heart is at  rest). The key blood pressure numbers to keep in mind are:  • Ideal. 120 over 80 or below  • Prehypertension. Higher than 120 over 80 and lower than 139  over 89  • Hypertension.

African-Americans are more  likely to develop hypertension,  manifest it at a younger age, and  have higher blood pressure readings.  • Family history. There is a strong  genetic component to high blood  pressure, and an individual’s risk  goes up along with the number of  family members who have  hypertension.  • Weight. Roughly 60  percent of people with  hypertension are obese.  • Sodium consumption.  The more salt in a  person’s diet, the more  likely they are to have  high blood pressure.  • Alcohol. Drinking more  than two drinks per day  for men and one drink  for women increases the  likelihood of  hypertension.  • Diet. In addition to salt  and alcohol  consumption, other  dietary factors increase  chances of developing  hypertension.  Steps to Reducing the Risk of High Blood Pressure  Although it is not possible to change one’s age or genetics, there are  actions that people can take to decrease their risk of hypertension.  Techniques to reduce blood pressure include becoming physically  active, maintaining a healthy weight, reducing sodium intake below  2,400 milligrams per day (or below 1,500 milligrams if you are in a  high-risk group or already have been diagnosed with hypertension),  using alcohol moderately, and following the DASH diet. Additionally,  vitamin C, calcium, and potassium have all been shown to promote  healthy blood pressure. It is also vital to monitor your blood  pressure levels on a regular basis. Prompt intervention when  readings rise above the ideal level (120 over 80) can save lives, which  is why everyone should know the status of their blood pressure.  1104  |  Threats to Health\n",

Cancer is triggered by mutations in a cell’s genetic  material. The cause of these changes may be inherited, or it may  result from exposure to carcinogens, which are agents that can  cause cancer. Carcinogens include chemicals, viruses, certain  medical treatments such as radiation, pollution, or other substances  and exposures that are known or suspected to cause cancer.4 The  National Institutes of Health has classified fifty-four different  compounds as known cancer-causing agents in humans.5  Under normal conditions, a healthy cell will either repair any  damage that has been done or self destruct so that no future cells  will be affected. Cells become cancerous when their DNA is  damaged, but they do not self-destruct or stop reproducing as  normal cells would. As these abnormal cells continue their rapid  growth, in most cancers they coalesce in a mass called a tumor.

Fruits and vegetables containing a wide variety of nutrients  and phytochemicals may either prevent or reduce the oxidative  damage to cell structures. Cruciferous vegetables, such as  cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts, may also reduce the risk  of certain cancers, such as endometrial, esophageal, and others.

In addition, regular and vigorous  exercise can lower the risk of breast and colon cancers, among  others. Also, wear sunblock, stay in the shade, and avoid the midday  sun to protect yourself from skin cancer, which is one of the most  common kinds of cancer.8  Diabetes  What Is Diabetes?  Diabetes is one of the top three diseases in America. It affects  millions of people and causes tens of thousands of deaths each year.  Diabetes is a metabolic disease of insulin deficiency and glucose  over-sufficiency.  Like  other  diseases,  genetics,  nutrition,  environment, and lifestyle are all involved in determining a person’s  risk for developing diabetes. One sure way to decrease your chances  of getting diabetes is to maintain an optimal body weight by  adhering to a diet that is balanced in carbohydrate, fat, and protein  intake. There are three different types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes,  Type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes.  8. Cancer Prevention: 7 Steps to Reduce Your Risk.

            "Type 1 Diabetes  Type 1 diabetes is a metabolic disease in which insulin-secreting  cells in the pancreas are killed by an abnormal response of the  immune system, causing a lack of insulin in the body. Its onset  typically occurs before the age of thirty. The only way to prevent the  deadly symptoms of this disease is to inject insulin under the skin.  A person with Type 1 diabetes usually has a rapid onset of  symptoms that include hunger, excessive thirst and urination, and  rapid weight loss. Because the main function of glucose is to provide  energy for the body, when insulin is no longer present there is no  message sent to cells to take up glucose from the blood. Instead,  cells use fat and proteins to make energy, resulting in weight loss.  If Type 1 diabetes goes untreated individuals with the disease will  develop a life-threatening condition called ketoacidosis. This  condition occurs when the body uses fats and not glucose to make  energy, resulting in a build-up of ketone bodies in the blood. It is  a severe form of ketosis with symptoms of vomiting, dehydration,  rapid breathing, and confusion and eventually coma and death.  Upon insulin injection these severe symptoms are treated and death  is avoided. Unfortunately, while insulin injection prevents death, it  is not considered a cure. People who have this disease must adhere  to a strict diet to prevent the development of serious complications.  Type 1 diabetics are advised to consume a diet low in the types  of carbohydrates that rapidly spike glucose levels (high-GI foods),  to count the carbohydrates they eat, to consume healthy- carbohydrate foods, and to eat small meals frequently. These  guidelines are aimed at preventing large fluctuations in blood  glucose. Frequent exercise also helps manage blood-glucose levels.  Type 1 diabetes accounts for between 5 and 10 percent of diabetes  cases.  1110  |  Threats to Health\n",
            "Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  Type 2 Diabetes  The other 90 to 95 percent of diabetes cases are Type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes is defined as a metabolic disease of insulin  insufficiency, but it is also caused by muscle, liver, and fat cells no  longer responding to the insulin in the body (Figure 18.4 “Healthy  Individuals and Type 2 Diabetes” . In brief, cells in the body have  become resistant to insulin and no longer receive the full  physiological message of insulin to take up glucose from the blood.  Thus, similar to patients with Type 1 diabetes, those with Type 2  diabetes also have high blood-glucose levels.  Figure 18.4 Healthy Individuals and Type 2 Diabetes  Threats to Health  |  1111\n",
            "For Type 2 diabetics, the onset of symptoms is more gradual and  less noticeable than for Type 1 diabetics. The first stage of Type  2 diabetes is characterized by high glucose and insulin levels. This  is because the insulin-secreting cells in the pancreas attempt to  compensate for insulin resistance by making more insulin. In the  second stage of Type 2 diabetes, the insulin-secreting cells in the  pancreas become exhausted and die. At this point, Type 2 diabetics  also have to be treated with insulin injections. Healthcare providers  is to prevent the second stage from happening. As with Type 1  diabetes, chronically high-glucose levels cause big detriments to  health over time, so another goal for patients with Type 2 diabetes  is to properly manage their blood-glucose levels. The front-line  approach for treating Type 2 diabetes includes eating a healthy diet  and increasing physical activity.  The Centers for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) estimates that  as of 2010, 25.8 million Americans have diabetes, which is 8.3  percent of the population.9 In 2007 the cost of diabetes to the  United States was estimated at $174 billion.10 The incidence of Type  2 diabetes has more than doubled in America in the past thirty  years and the rise is partly attributed to the increase in obesity  in this country. Genetics, environment, nutrition, and lifestyle all  play a role in determining a person’s risk for Type 2 diabetes.

The Diabetes Prevention Trial that studied lifestyle and  drug interventions in more than three thousand participants who  were at high risk for Type 2 diabetes found that intensive lifestyle  intervention reduced the chances of getting Type 2 diabetes by 58  percent.11  Gestational Diabetes  During pregnancy some women develop gestational diabetes.  Gestational diabetes is characterized by high blood-glucose levels  and insulin resistance. The exact cause is not known but does  involve the effects of pregnancy hormones on how cells respond  to insulin. Gestational diabetes can cause pregnancy complications  and it is common practice for healthcare practitioners to screen  pregnant women for this metabolic disorder. The disorder normally  ceases when the pregnancy is over, but the National Diabetes  Information Clearing House notes that women who had gestational  diabetes have between a 40 and 60 percent likelihood of developing  Type 2 diabetes within the next ten years.12 Gestational diabetes not  only affects the health of a pregnant woman but also is associated  with an increased risk of obesity and Type 2 diabetes in her child.  11. Knowler WC.

Over seventy-nine million  Americans are prediabetic and at increased risk for Type 2 diabetes  and cardiovascular disease.13 The National Diabetes Information  Clearing House reports that 35 percent of adults aged twenty and  older, and 50 percent of those over the age of sixty-five have  prediabetes.14  Long-Term Health Consequences of Diabetes  The long-term health consequences of diabetes are severe. They  are the result of chronically high glucose concentrations in the  blood accompanied by other metabolic abnormalities such as high  blood-lipid levels. People with diabetes are between two and four  times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease. Diabetes is  the number one cause of new cases of blindness, lower-limb  amputations, and kidney failure.

Diabetes Treatment  Keeping blood-glucose levels in the target range (70–130 mg/dL  before a meal) requires careful monitoring of blood-glucose levels  with a blood-glucose meter, strict adherence to a healthy diet, and  increased physical activity. Type 1 diabetics begin insulin injections  as soon as they are diagnosed. Type 2 diabetics may require oral  medications and insulin injections to maintain blood-glucose levels  in the target range. The symptoms of high blood glucose, also called  hyperglycemia, are difficult to recognize, diminish in the course  of diabetes, and are mostly not apparent until levels become very  high. The symptoms are increased thirst and frequent urination.  Having too low blood glucose levels, known as hypoglycemia, is  also detrimental to health. Hypoglycemia is more common in Type  1 diabetics and is most often caused by injecting too much insulin  or injecting it at the wrong time. The symptoms of hypoglycemia  are more acute including shakiness, sweating, nausea, hunger,  clamminess, fatigue, confusion, irritability, stupor, seizures, and  coma. Hypoglycemia can be rapidly and simply treated by eating  foods containing about ten to twenty grams of fast-releasing  carbohydrates. If symptoms are severe a person is either treated by  emergency care providers with an intravenous solution of glucose  or given an injection of glucagon, which mobilizes glucose from  glycogen in the liver. Some people who are not diabetic may  experience reactive hypoglycemia. This is a condition in which  people are sensitive to the intake of sugars, refined starches, and  high GI foods. Individuals with reactive hypoglycemia have some  symptoms of hypoglycemia. Symptoms are caused by a higher than  normal increase in blood-insulin levels. This rapidly decreases  blood-glucose levels to a level below what is required for proper  brain function.  Threats to Health  |  1115\n",
            "The major determinants of Type 2 diabetes that can be changed  are overnutrition and a sedentary lifestyle. Therefore, reversing or  improving these factors by lifestyle interventions markedly improve  the overall health of Type 2 diabetics and lower blood-glucose  levels. In fact it has been shown that when people are overweight,  losing as little as nine pounds (four kilograms) decreases blood- glucose levels in Type 2 diabetics. The Diabetes Prevention Trial  demonstrated that by adhering to a diet containing between 1,200  and 1,800 kilocalories per day with a dietary fat intake goal of less  than 25 percent and increasing physical activity to at least 150  minutes per week, people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes achieved  a weight loss of 7 percent and significantly decreased their chances  of developing Type 2 diabetes.15  The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has a website that  provides information and tips for helping diabetics answer the  question, “What Can I Eat”. In regard to carbohydrates the ADA  recommends diabetics keep track of the carbohydrates they eat and  set a limit. These dietary practices will help keep blood-glucose  levels in the target range.

            "Undernutrition,  Overnutrition, and  Malnutrition  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  For many, the word “malnutrition” produces an image of a child in  a third-world country with a bloated belly, and skinny arms and  legs. However, this image alone is not an accurate representation of  the state of malnutrition. For example, someone who is 150 pounds  overweight can also be malnourished.  Malnutrition refers to one not receiving proper nutrition and does  not distinguish between the consequences of too many nutrients  or the lack of nutrients, both of which impair overall health.  Undernutrition is characterized by a lack of nutrients and  insufficient energy supply, whereas overnutrition is characterized  by excessive nutrient and energy intake. Overnutrition can result  in obesity, a growing global health threat. Obesity is defined as a  metabolic disorder that leads to an overaccumulation of fat tissue.  Although not as prevalent in America as it is in developing  countries, undernutrition is not uncommon and affects many  subpopulations, including the elderly, those with certain diseases,  and those in poverty. Many people who live with diseases either  have no appetite or may not be able to digest food properly. Some  medical causes of malnutrition include cancer, inflammatory bowel  syndrome, AIDS, Alzheimer’s disease, illnesses or conditions that  cause chronic pain, psychiatric illnesses, such as anorexia nervosa,  or as a result of side effects from medications. Overnutrition is an  epidemic in the United States and is known to be a risk factor for  many diseases, including Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease,  inflammatory disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis), and cancer.

In children, being underweight can stunt growth. The  most common underlying cause of underweight in America is  inadequate nutrition. Other causes are wasting diseases, such as  cancer, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, and eating disorders. People  with wasting diseases are encouraged to seek nutritional  counseling, as a healthy diet greatly affects survival and improves  responses to disease treatments. Eating disorders that result in  underweight affect about eight million Americans (seven million  women and one million men).

Anorexia is  relatively rare—the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)  reports that 0.9 percent of females and 0.3 percent of males will  have anorexia at some point in their lifetime, but it is an extreme  example of how an unbalanced diet can affect health.2  Anorexia frequently manifests during adolescence and it has the  highest rate of mortality of all mental illnesses. People with anorexia  consume, on average, fewer than 1,000 kilocalories per day and  exercise excessively. They are in a tremendous caloric imbalance.  Moreover, some may participate in binge eating, self-induced  vomiting, and purging with laxatives or enemas. The very first time  a person starves him- or herself may trigger the onset of anorexia.  The exact causes of anorexia are not completely known, but many  things contribute to its development including economic status, as  it is most prevalent in high-income families. It is a genetic disease  and is often passed from one generation to the next. Pregnancy  complications and abnormalities in the brain, endocrine system,  and immune system may all contribute to the development of this  illness.  The primary signs of anorexia are fear of being overweight,  extreme dieting, an unusual perception of body image, and  depression. The secondary signs and symptoms of anorexia are all  related to the caloric and nutrient deficiencies of the unbalanced  diet and include excessive weight loss, a multitude of skin  abnormalities, diarrhea, cavities and tooth loss, osteoporosis, and  liver, kidney, and heart failure.

Eliminating these other possibilities involves  numerous blood tests, urine tests, and x-rays. Coexisting organ  malfunction is also examined. Treatment of any mental illness  involves not only the individual, but also family, friends, and a  psychiatric counselor. Treating anorexia also involves a dietitian,  who helps to provide dietary solutions that often have to be  adjusted over time. The goals of treatment for anorexia are to  restore a healthy body weight and significantly reduce the behaviors  associated with causing the eating disorder. Relapse to an  unbalanced diet is high. Many people do recover from anorexia,  however most continue to have a lower-than-normal body weight  for the rest of their lives.  Bulimia Nervosa  Bulimia nervosa, like anorexia, is a psychiatric illness that can have  severe health consequences. The NIMH reports that 0.5 percent  of females and 0.1 percent of males will have bulimia nervosa, or  otherwise known as bulimia, at some point in their lifetime.3  Bulimia is characterized by episodes of eating large amounts of  food followed by purging, which is accomplished by vomiting and  with the use of laxatives and diuretics. Unlike people with anorexia,  those with bulimia often have a normal weight, making the disorder  more difficult to detect and diagnose. The disorder is characterized  3. Eating Disorders.

Secondary signs  and symptoms include gastric reflux, severe erosion of tooth  enamel, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, lacerations in the  mouth from vomiting, and peptic ulcers. Repeated damage to the  esophagus puts people with bulimia at an increased risk for  esophageal cancer. The disorder is also highly genetic, linked to  depression and anxiety disorders, and most commonly occurs in  adolescent girls and young women. Treatment often involves  antidepressant medications and, like anorexia, has better results  when both the family and the individual with the disorder  participate in nutritional and psychiatric counseling.  Binge-Eating Disorder  Similar to those who experience anorexia and bulimia, people who  have a binge-eating disorder have lost control over their eating.  Binge-eating disorder is not currently diagnosed as a distinct  psychiatric illness, although there is a proposal from the American  Psychiatric Association to categorize it more specifically. People  with binge-eating disorder will periodically overeat to the extreme,  but their loss of control over eating is not followed by fasting,  purging, or compulsive exercise. As a result, people with this  disorder are often overweight or obese, and their chronic disease  risks are those linked to having an abnormally high body weight  such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and Type 2 diabetes.  Additionally, they often experience guilt, shame, and depression.  Binge-eating disorder is commonly associated with depression and  anxiety disorders.

            "Food Insecurity  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Addressing Hunger  Government agencies also play an important role in addressing  hunger via federal food-assistance programs. The agencies provide  debit cards (formerly distributed in the form of food vouchers or  food stamps) to consumers to help them purchase food and they  also provide other forms of aid to low-income adults and families  who face hunger and nutritional deficits. This topic will be  discussed in greater detail later in this chapter.  Hunger relates to appetite and is the body’s response to a need for  nourishment. Through stomach discomfort or intestinal rumbling,  the body alerts the brain that it requires food. This uneasy sensation  is easily addressed with a snack or a full meal. However, the term  “hunger” also relates to a weakened condition that is a consequence  of a prolonged lack of food. People who suffer from this form of  hunger typically experience malnourishment, along with poor  growth and development.  Hunger  Adequate food intake that meets nutritional requirements is  essential to achieve a healthy, productive lifestyle. However, millions  of people in North America, not to mention globally, go hungry and  are malnourished each year due to a recurring and involuntary lack  1132  |  Food Insecurity\n",
            "of food. The economic crisis of 2008 caused a dramatic increase in  hunger across the United States.1  In 2010, 925 million people around the world were classified as  hungry. Although this was a decrease from a historic high of more  than one billion people from the previous year, it is still an  unbearable number. Every night, millions and millions of people go  to sleep hungry due to a lack of the money or resources needed to  acquire an adequate amount of food. This graph shows the division  of hungry people around the globe. A number of terms are used to  categorize and classify hunger. Two key terms, food security and  food insecurity, focus on status and affect hunger statistics. Another  term, malnutrition, refers to the deficiencies that a hungry person  experiences.  Food Security  Most American households are considered to be food secure, which  means they have adequate access to food and consume enough  nutrients to achieve a healthy lifestyle. However, a minority of US  households experiences food insecurity at certain points during the  year, which means their access to food is limited due to a lack  of money or other resources. This graphic shows the percentage  of food-secure and food-insecure households in the United States  during the year 2010.  1. Hunger in America: 2016 United States Hunger and  Poverty Facts.

            "Food Insecurity  Food insecurity is defined as not having adequate access to food  that meets nutritional needs. According to the USDA, about 48.8  million people live in food-insecure households and have reported  multiple indications of food access problems. About sixteen million  of those have “very low food security,” which means one or more  people in the household were hungry at some point over the course  of a year due to the inability to afford enough food. The difference  between low and very low food security is that members of low  insecurity households have reported problems of food access, but  have reported only a few instances of reduced food intake, if any.2  African American and Hispanic households experience food  insecurity at much higher rates than the national average.3  Households with limited resources employ a variety of methods to  increase their access to adequate food. Some families purchase junk  food and fast food—cheaper options that are also very unhealthy.  Other families who struggle with food security supplement the  groceries they purchase by participating in government assistance  2. Coleman-Jensen A.

Malnutrition  A person living in a food-insecure household may suffer from  malnutrition, which results from a failure to meet nutrient  requirements. This can occur as a result of consuming too little  food or not enough key nutrients. There are two basic types of  malnutrition. The first is macronutrient deficiency and relates to  the lack of adequate protein, which is required for cell growth,  maintenance, and repair. The second type of malnutrition is  micronutrient deficiency and relates to inadequate vitamin and  mineral intake.4 Even people who are overweight or obese can  suffer from this kind of malnutrition if they eat foods that do not  meet all of their nutritional needs.  Worldwide, three main groups are most at risk of hunger: the  rural poor in developing nations who also lack access to electricity  and safe drinking water, the urban poor who live in expanding cities  and lack the means to buy food, and victims of earthquakes,  hurricanes, and other natural and man-made catastrophes.5  4. Hunger in America: 2016 United States Hunger and  Poverty Facts.

            "In the United States, there are additional subgroups that are at  risk and are more likely than others to face hunger and malnutrition.  They include low-income families and the working poor, who are  employed but have incomes below the federal poverty level.  Senior citizens are also a major at-risk group. Many elderly people  are frail and isolated, which affects their ability to meet their dietary  requirements. In addition, many also have low incomes, limited  resources, and difficulty purchasing or preparing food due to health  issues or poor mobility. As a result, more than six million senior  citizens in the United States face the threat of hunger.6  One of the groups that struggles with hunger are the millions  of homeless people across North America. According to a recent  study by the US Conference of Mayors, the majority of reporting  cities saw an increase in the number of homeless families.7 Hunger  and homelessness often go hand-in-hand as homeless families and  adults turn to soup kitchens or food pantries or resort to begging  for food.  Rising hunger rates in the United States particularly affect  children. Nearly one out of four children, or 21.6 percent of all  American children, lives in a food-insecure household and spends  at least part of the year hungry.8 Hunger delays their growth and  6. About Meals on Wheels.

In addition, children who are undernourished are more  susceptible to contracting diseases, such as measles and  pneumonia.9  Government Programs  The federal government has established a number of programs that  work to alleviate hunger and ensure that many low-income families  receive the nutrition they require to live a healthy life. A number  of programs were strengthened by the passage of the Healthy,  Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. This legislation authorized funding  and set the policy for several key core programs that provide a  safety net for food-insecure children across the United States.  The federal poverty level (FPL) is used to determine eligibility for  food-assistance programs. This monetary figure is the minimum  amount that a family would need to acquire shelter, food, clothing,  and other necessities. It is calculated based on family size and is  adjusted for annual inflation. Although many people who fall below  the FPL are unemployed, the working poor can qualify for food  Economic Research Report, no.

USDA Food Assistance Programs  Government food and nutrition assistance programs that are  organized and operated by the USDA work to increase food security.  They provide low-income households with access to food, the tools  for consuming a healthy diet, and education about nutrition. The  USDA monitors the extent and severity of food insecurity via an  annual survey. This contributes to the efficiency of food assistance  programs as well as the effectiveness of private charities and other  initiatives aimed at reducing food insecurity.10  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  Formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides monthly benefits for  low-income households to purchase approved food items at  authorized stores. Clients qualify for the program based on available  household income, assets, and certain basic expenses.

In the decades  since, the organization has expanded into a vast network that serves  the elderly in all fifty states and several US territories. Today, Meals  on Wheels remains committed to ending hunger among the senior  citizen community.15  Nutrition and Your Health  The adage, “you are what you eat,” seems to be more true today than  ever. In recent years, consumers have become more conscientious  about the decisions they make in the supermarket. Organically  grown food is the fastest growing segment of the food industry.  Also, farmers’ markets and chains that are health-food-oriented are  thriving in many parts of North America. Shoppers have begun to  pay more attention to the effect of food on their health and well- being. That includes not only the kinds of foods that they purchase,  but also the manner in which meals are cooked and consumed.  The preparation of food can greatly affect its nutritional value. Also,  studies have shown that eating at a table with family members or  friends can promote both health and happiness.  15. The Problem and Our Solution.

Both  registered dietitians (RD) and nutritionists provide nutrition-related  services to people in the private and public sectors. A RD is a  healthcare professional who has credentials from the Commission  on Dietetic Registration and can provide nutritional care in the  areas of health and wellness for both individuals and groups. A  nutritionist is an unregistered professional who may have acquired  the knowledge via other avenues. RDs are nutrition professionals  who work to apply nutritional science, using evidence-based best  practices, to help people nourish their bodies and improve their  lives.  Becoming a RD requires a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in  dietetics from an accredited program, including courses in biology,  chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, anatomy and physiology,  nutrition, and food-service management. Other suggested courses  include  economics,  business,  statistics,  computer  science,  psychology, and sociology. In addition, people who pursue this path  must complete a dietetic internship and pass a national exam. Also,  some states have licensure that requires additional forms and  documentation. To become a dietetic technician registered you  must complete an undergraduate dietetic program and pass a  national exam. Forty-seven states have licensure requirements for  RDs and nutritionists.

Working in Nutrition  Registered dietitians (RDs)/registered dietitians nutritionist (RDNs)  and nutritionists plan food and nutrition programs, promote healthy  eating habits, and recommend dietary modifications based on the  needs of individuals or groups. For example, an RD/RDN might  teach a patient with hypertension how to follow the DASH diet  and reduce their sodium intake. Nutrition-related careers can be  extremely varied. Some individuals work in the government, while  others are solely in the private sectors (i.e., private practice,  worksite wellness, hospitals, outpatient clinics, etc). Some jobs in  nutrition focus on working with elite athletes, while others provide  guidance to patients with long-term, life-threatening diseases. But  no matter the circumstance or the clientele, working in the field of  diet and nutrition focuses on helping people improve their dietary  habits by translating nutritional science and evidence-based  recommendations into food choices.  In the public sector, careers in nutrition span from government  work to community outreach. RDs who work for the government  may become involved with federal food programs, federal agencies,  communication campaigns, or creating and analyzing public policy.

Clinical dietitians also confer with  doctors and other health-care professionals to coordinate dietary  recommendations with medical needs. Nutrition jobs in the  community often involve working in public health clinics,  cooperative extension offices, and HMOs to prevent disease and  promote the health of the local community. Nutrition jobs in the  nonprofit world involve anti-hunger organizations, public health  organizations, and activist groups.  Nutritionists and dietitians can also find work in the private  sector. Increased public awareness of food, diet, and nutrition has  led to employment opportunities in advertising, marketing, and  food manufacturing. Dietitians working in these areas analyze foods,  prepare marketing materials, or report on issues such as the impact  of vitamins and herbal supplements. Consultant careers can include  working in wellness programs, supermarkets, physicians’ offices,  gyms, and weight-loss clinics. Consultants in private practice  perform nutrition screenings for clients and use their findings to  provide guidance on diet-related issues, such as weight reduction.  Nutrition careers in the corporate world include designing wellness  strategies and nutrition components for companies, working as  representatives for food or supplement companies, designing  marketing and educational campaigns, and becoming lobbyists.  Others in the private sector work in food-service management at  health-care facilities or at company and school cafeterias.  Sustainable agricultural practices are also providing interesting  private sector careers on farms and in food systems. There are  employment opportunities in farm management, marketing and  sales, compliance, finance, and land surveying and appraisal.  Careers in Nutrition  |  1145\n",

Remember, your ability to  wake up, to think clearly, communicate, hope, dream, go to school,  gain knowledge, and earn a living are totally dependent upon one  factor—your health. Good health allows you to function normally  and work hard to pursue your goals. Yet, achieving optimal health  cannot be underestimated. It is a complex process, involving  multiple dimensions of wellness, along with your physical or  medical reality. The knowledge you have now acquired is also key.  However, it is not enough to pass this nutrition class with good  grades. Nutrition knowledge must be applied to make a difference  in your life, throughout your life.  Throughout this textbook, we have focused on the different  aspects of nutrition science, which helps to optimize health and  prevent disease. Scientific evidence provides the basis for dietary  guidelines and recommendations. In addition, researchers in the  field of nutrition work to advance our knowledge of food production  and distribution. Nutrition science also examines the ill effects of  malnutrition and food insecurity.

When the evidence base  was considered inadequate to set a SUL, Guidance Levels were  set based on limited data. SULs and Guidance Levels tend to be  conservative and it is possible that, for some vitamins and minerals,  greater amounts could be consumed for short periods without risk  to health. The values presented are for a 60 kg (132 lb) adult. Consult  the full publication for values expressed per kg body weight. This  FSA publication, Safe Upper Levels for Vitamins and Minerals, is  available at: http:/ /www.foodstandards.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/ vitmin2003.pdf  eThe UL for magnesium represents intake specifically from  pharmacological agents and/or dietary supplements in addition to  dietary intake.    Appendix A  |  1155\n",

            "[Learning Objectives  By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:  •  Describe basic concepts in nutrition  •  Describe factors that affect your nutritional needs  •  Describe the importance of research and scientific  methods to understanding nutrition  What are Nutrients?,  The foods we eat contain nutrients., Nutrients are substances  required by the body to perform its basic functions., Nutrients must  be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not  synthesize or produce them., Nutrients have one or more of three  basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure,  and/or regulate chemical processes in the body., These basic  functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental  surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and  reproduce., There are six classes of nutrients required for the body  to function and maintain overall health., These are carbohydrates,  lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals., Foods also contain  non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common  in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or  beneficial (such as antioxidants).,  4  |  Introduction]\n",
            "[Macronutrients  Nutrients  that  are  needed  in  large  amounts  are  called  macronutrients., There are three classes of macronutrients:  carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins., These can be metabolically  processed into cellular energy., The energy from macronutrients  comes from their chemical bonds., This chemical energy is  converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,  allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions., A unit of  measurement of food energy is the calorie., On nutrition food labels  the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie  multiplied by one thousand., A kilocalorie (one thousand calories,  denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a  capital “C”) on nutrition food labels., Water is also a macronutrient in  the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other  macronutrients, it does not yield calories.,  Carbohydrates  Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and  oxygen., The major food sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk,  fruits, and starchy vegetables, like potatoes., Non-starchy vegetables  also contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities., Carbohydrates  are broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical  structure: simple carbohydrates, often called simple sugars; and  complex carbohydrates.,  Simple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units., Examples  of simple sugars include sucrose, the type of sugar you would have  in a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the type of sugar that  circulates in your blood.,  Complex carbohydrates are long chains of simple sugars that can  be unbranched or branched., During digestion, the body breaks  Introduction  |  5]\n",
            "[down digestible complex carbohydrates to simple sugars, mostly  glucose., Glucose is then transported to all our cells where it is  stored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules., Fiber  is also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by  digestive enzymes in the human intestine., As a result, it passes  through the digestive tract undigested unless the bacteria that  inhabit the colon or large intestine break it down.,  One gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of  energy for the cells in the body to perform work., In addition to  providing energy and serving as building blocks for bigger  macromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning  of the nervous system, heart, and kidneys., As mentioned, glucose  can be stored in the body for future use., In humans, the storage  molecule of carbohydrates is called glycogen, and in plants, it is  known as starch., Glycogen and starch are complex carbohydrates.,  Lipids  Lipids are also a family of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen,  and oxygen, but unlike carbohydrates, they are insoluble in water.,  Lipids are found predominantly in butter, oils, meats, dairy  products, nuts, and seeds, and in many processed foods., The three  main  types  of  lipids  are  triglycerides  (triacylglycerols),  phospholipids, and sterols., The main job of lipids is to provide or  store energy., Lipids provide more energy per gram than  carbohydrates (nine kilocalories per gram of lipids versus four  kilocalories per gram of carbohydrates)., In addition to energy  storage, lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes,  surround and protect organs (in fat-storing tissues), provide  insulation to aid in temperature regulation, and regulate many other  functions in the body.,  6  |  Introduction]\n",

            "[Image by  Allison  Calabrese /  CC BY 4.0  once it begins., As you swallow, the bolus is pushed from the mouth  through the pharynx and into a muscular tube called the esophagus.,  As the bolus travels through the pharynx, a small flap called the  epiglottis closes to prevent choking by keeping food from going  into the trachea., Peristaltic contractions also known as peristalsis in  the esophagus propel the food bolus down to the stomach (Figure  3.6 “Peristalsis in the Esophagus”)., At the junction between the  esophagus and stomach there is a sphincter muscle that remains  closed until the food bolus approaches., The pressure of the food  bolus stimulates the lower esophageal sphincter to relax and open  and food then moves from the esophagus into the stomach., The  mechanical breakdown of food is accentuated by the muscular  contractions of the stomach and small intestine that mash, mix,  slosh, and propel food down the alimentary canal., Solid food takes  between four and eight seconds to travel down the esophagus, and  liquids take about one second.,  Figure 2.6 Peristalsis in the Esophagus  The Digestive System  |  73]\n",
            "[From the Stomach to the Small Intestine  When food enters the stomach, a highly muscular organ, powerful  peristaltic contractions help mash, pulverize, and churn food into  chyme., Chyme is a semiliquid mass of partially digested food that  also contains gastric juices secreted by cells in the stomach., These  gastric juices contain hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin, that  chemically start breakdown of the protein components of food.,  The length of time food spends in the stomach varies by the  macronutrient composition of the meal., A high-fat or high-protein  meal takes longer to break down than one rich in carbohydrates.,  It usually takes a few hours after a meal to empty the stomach  contents completely into the small intestine.,  The small intestine is divided into three structural parts: the  duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum., Once the chyme enters the  duodenum (the first segment of the small intestine), the pancreas  and gallbladder are stimulated and release juices that aid in  digestion., The pancreas secretes up to 1.5 liters (.4 US gallons) of  pancreatic juice through a duct into the duodenum per day., This  fluid consists mostly of water, but it also contains bicarbonate ions  that neutralize the acidity of the stomach-derived chyme and  enzymes that further break down proteins, carbohydrates, and  lipids., The gallbladder secretes a much smaller amount of a fluid  called bile that helps to digest fats., Bile passes through a duct that  joins the pancreatic ducts and is released into the duodenum., Bile  is made in the liver and stored in the gall bladder., Bile’s components  act like detergents by surrounding fats similar to the way dish soap  removes grease from a frying pan., This allows for the movement of  fats in the watery environment of the small intestine., Two different  types of muscular contractions, called peristalsis and segmentation,  control the movement and mixing of the food in various stages of  digestion through the small intestine.,  Similar to what occurs in the esophagus and stomach, peristalsis  is circular waves of smooth muscle contraction that propel food  74  |  The Digestive System]\n",

Estimating Caloric Content  The energy contained in energy-yielding nutrients differs because  the energy-yielding nutrients are composed of different types of  chemical bonds., The carbohydrate or protein in a food yields  approximately 4 kilocalories per gram, whereas the triglycerides  that compose the fat in a food yield 9 kilocalories per gram., A  kilocalorie of energy performs one thousand times more work than  a calorie., On the Nutrition Facts panel found on packaged food, the  calories listed for a particular food are actually kilocalories.,  Estimating the number of calories in commercially prepared food  is fairly easy since the total number of calories in a serving of a  particular food is listed on the Nutrition Facts panel., If you wanted  to know the number of calories in the breakfast you consumed  this morning just add up the number of calories in each food., For  example, if you ate one serving of yogurt that contained 150 calories,  on which you sprinkled half of a cup of low-fat granola cereal that  contained 209 calories, and drank a glass of orange juice that  contained 100 calories, the total number of calories you consumed  at breakfast is 150 + 209 + 100 = 459 calories., If you do not have  a Nutrition Facts panel for a certain food, such as a half cup of  blueberries, and want to find out the amount of calories it contains,  go to Food-a-pedia, a website maintained by the USDA., For more  456  |  Introduction]\n",

The breakdown of fatty  acids begins with the catabolic pathway, known as β-oxidation,  which takes place in the mitochondria., In this catabolic pathway,  four enzymatic steps sequentially remove two-carbon molecules  from long chains of fatty acids, yielding acetyl-CoA molecules., In the  case of amino acids, once the nitrogen is removed from the amino  acid the remaining carbon skeleton can be enzymatically converted  into acetyl-CoA or some other intermediate of the citric acid cycle.,  Acetyl-CoA, a two-carbon molecule common to glucose, lipid, and  protein metabolism enters the second stage of energy metabolism,  the citric acid cycle.,  In the citric acid cycle, acetyl-CoA is joined to a four-carbon  molecule., In this multistep pathway, two carbons are lost as two  The Atom  |  465]\n",

Carotenoids are pigments synthesized by plants that give them  their yellow, orange, and red color., Over six hundred carotenoids  have been identified and, with just a few exceptions, all are found  in the plant kingdom., There are two classes of carotenoids—the  xanthophylls, which contain oxygen, and the carotenes, which do  not.,  In plants, carotenoids absorb light for use in photosynthesis and  act as antioxidants., Beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta- cryptoxanthin are converted to some extent to retinol in the body.,  The other carotenoids, such as lycopene, are not., Many biological  actions of carotenoids are attributed to their antioxidant activity,  but they likely act by other mechanisms, too.,  Vitamin A is fat-soluble and is packaged into chylomicrons in  small intestine, and transported to the liver., The liver stores and  exports vitamin A as needed; it is released into the blood bound to a  retinol-binding protein, which transports it to cells., Carotenoids are  not absorbed as well as vitamin A, but similar to vitamin A, they do  require fat in the meal for absorption., In intestinal cells, carotenoids  Fat-Soluble Vitamins  |  521]\n",

            "[Calcium  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Calcium’s Functional Roles  Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body and greater than  99 percent of it is stored in bone tissue., Although only 1 percent of  the calcium in the human body is found in the blood and soft tissues,  it is here that it performs the most critical functions., Blood calcium  levels are rigorously controlled so that if blood levels drop the body  will rapidly respond by stimulating bone resorption, thereby  releasing stored calcium into the blood.,  Thus, bone tissue sacrifices  its stored calcium to maintain blood calcium levels., This is why bone  health is dependent on the intake of dietary calcium and also why  blood levels of calcium do not always correspond to dietary intake.,  Calcium plays a role in a number of different functions in the  body like bone and tooth formation., The most well-known calcium  function is to build and strengthen bones and teeth., Recall that  when bone tissue first forms during the modeling or remodeling  process, it is unhardened, protein-rich osteoid tissue., In the  osteoblast-directed process of bone mineralization, calcium  phosphates (salts) are deposited on the protein matrix., The calcium  salts typically make up about 65 percent of bone tissue., When your  diet is calcium deficient, the mineral content of bone decreases  causing it to become brittle and weak., Thus, increased calcium  intake helps to increase the mineralized content of bone tissue.,  Greater mineralized bone tissue corresponds to a greater BMD,  and to greater bone strength., The remaining calcium plays a role  in nerve impulse transmission by facilitating electrical impulse  transmission from one nerve cell to another., Calcium in muscle cells  Calcium  |  613]\n",
            "[is essential for muscle contraction because the flow of calcium ions  are needed for the muscle proteins (actin and myosin) to interact.,  Calcium is also essential in blood clotting by activating clotting  factors to fix damaged tissue.,  In addition to calcium’s four primary functions calcium has  several other minor functions that are also critical for maintaining  normal physiology., For example, without calcium, the hormone  insulin could not be released from cells in the pancreas and  glycogen could not be broken down in muscle cells and used to  provide energy for muscle contraction.,  Maintaining Calcium Levels  Because calcium performs such vital functions in the body, blood  calcium level is closely regulated by the hormones parathyroid  hormone (PTH), calcitriol, and calcitonin., When blood calcium levels  are low, PTH is secreted to increase blood calcium levels via three  different mechanisms., First, PTH stimulates the release of calcium  stored in the bone., Second, PTH acts on kidney cells to increase  calcium reabsorption and decrease its excretion in the urine., Third,  PTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that activate vitamin D to  calcitriol.,  Calcitriol is the active hormone that acts on the intestinal  cells and increases dietary calcium absorption., When blood calcium  levels become too high, the hormone calcitonin is secreted by  certain cells in the thyroid gland and PTH secretion stops.,   At higher  nonphysiological concentrations, calcitonin lowers blood calcium  levels by increasing calcium excretion in the urine, preventing  further absorption of calcium in the gut and by directly inhibiting  bone resorption.,  Figure 10.2 Maintaining Blood Calcium Levels  614  |  Calcium]\n",

            "[Diet, Supplements, and Chelated Supplements  In general, calcium supplements perform to a lesser degree than  dietary sources of calcium in providing many of the health benefits  linked to higher calcium intake., This is partly attributed to the fact  that dietary sources of calcium supply additional nutrients with  health-promoting activities., It is reported that chelated forms of  calcium supplements are easier to absorb as the chelation process  protects the calcium from oxalates and phytates that may bind with  the calcium in the intestines., However, these are more expensive  supplements and only increase calcium absorption up to 10 percent.,  In people with low dietary intakes of calcium, calcium supplements  have a negligible benefit on bone health in the absence of a vitamin  D supplement., However, when calcium supplements are taken along  with vitamin D, there are many benefits to bone health: peak bone  mass is increased in early adulthood, BMD is maintained throughout  adulthood, the risk of developing osteoporosis is reduced, and the  incidence of fractures is decreased in those who already had  osteoporosis., Calcium and vitamin D pills do not have to be taken at  the same time for effectiveness., But remember that vitamin D has to  be activated and in the bloodstream to promote calcium absorption.,  Thus, it is important to maintain an adequate intake of vitamin D.

In human studies, excessive fructose intake has sometimes been  associated with weight gain, but results are inconsistent. Moderate  fructose intake is not associated with weight gain at all. Moreover,  other studies show that some fructose in the diet actually improves  glucose metabolism especially in people with Type 2 diabetes.5  In fact, people with diabetes were once advised to use fructose  as an alternative sweetener to table sugar. Overall, there is no good  evidence that moderate fructose consumption contributes to  weight gain and chronic disease. At this time conclusive evidence  is not available on whether fructose is any worse than any other  added sugar in increasing the risk for obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and  cardiovascular disease.  Do Low-Carbohydrate Diets Affect Health?  Since the early 1990s, marketers of low-carbohydrate diets have  bombarded us with the idea that eating fewer carbohydrates  promotes weight loss and that these diets are superior to others in  their effects on weight loss and overall health. The most famous of  these low-carbohydrate diets is the Atkins diet. Others include the  “South Beach” diet, the “Zone” diet, and the “Earth” diet. Despite the  claims these diets make, there is little scientific evidence to support  that low-carbohydrate diets are significantly better than other diets  in promoting long-term weight loss.

Why then, does the water not flow from blood  plasma to cells? The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.  A concentration gradient is a form of potential energy, like water  172  |  Electrolytes Important for Fluid Balance\",\n          \"Units of Measure  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI\\u2018I AT M\\u0100NOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  In  nutrition,  there  are  two  systems  of  commonly  used  measurements: Metric and US Customary.

For example, dental problems can lead to difficulties  with chewing and swallowing, which in turn can make it hard to  maintain a healthy diet. The use of dentures or the preparation of  pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also  is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have  a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to  dehydration.  Sensory Issues  At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number.  As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning  that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste.  Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty,  sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less  appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in  sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those  tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes  toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because  the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of  digestive\\u00a0enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.  Dysphagia  Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition  because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to  swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control  swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common  cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia  because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults  suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency.

Why then, does the water not flow from blood  plasma to cells? The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.  A concentration gradient is a form of potential energy, like water  172  |  Electrolytes Important for Fluid Balance\",\n          \"Units of Measure  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI\\u2018I AT M\\u0100NOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  In  nutrition,  there  are  two  systems  of  commonly  used  measurements: Metric and US Customary.

For example, dental problems can lead to difficulties  with chewing and swallowing, which in turn can make it hard to  maintain a healthy diet. The use of dentures or the preparation of  pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also  is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have  a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to  dehydration.  Sensory Issues  At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number.  As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning  that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste.  Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty,  sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less  appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in  sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those  tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes  toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because  the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of  digestive\\u00a0enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.  Dysphagia  Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition  because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to  swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control  swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common  cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia  because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults  suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency.

At  that point, levels of the hormone prolactin increase to stimulate the  growth of the milk duct system, which initiates and maintains milk  production. Also during pregnancy, progesterone stimulates growth  of the alveoli, the clusters of cells where the milk is made. During  this process ducts that will carry the milk grow larger and branch  out, and new capillaries are also formed to circulate the increased  blood supply.

The teeth begin the  mechanical breakdown of the large egg pieces into smaller pieces  that can be swallowed. The salivary glands provide some saliva to  aid swallowing and the passage of the partially mashed egg through  the esophagus. The mashed egg pieces enter the stomach through  the esophageal sphincter. The stomach releases gastric juices  containing hydrochloric acid and the enzyme, pepsin, which initiate  the breakdown of the protein. The acidity of the stomach facilitates  the unfolding of the proteins that still retain part of their three- dimensional structure after cooking and helps break down the  protein aggregates formed during cooking. Pepsin, which is  secreted by the cells that line the stomach, dismantles the protein  chains into smaller and smaller fragments. Egg proteins are large  globular molecules and their chemical breakdown requires time  and mixing. The powerful mechanical stomach contractions churn  the partially digested protein into a more uniform mixture called  chyme. Protein digestion in the stomach takes a longer time than  carbohydrate digestion, but a shorter time than fat digestion.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

There are three classes of macronutrients:  carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically  processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients  comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is  converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,  allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of  measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels  the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie  multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories,  denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a  capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in  the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other  macronutrients, it does not yield calories. Carbohydrates  Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and  oxygen.',\n",

            "Macronutrients  Nutrients  that  are  needed  in  large  amounts  are  called  macronutrients. There are three classes of macronutrients:  carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically  processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients  comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is  converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,  allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of  measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels  the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie  multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories,  denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a  capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in  the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other  macronutrients, it does not yield calories. Carbohydrates  Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and  oxygen.\n",

            "Water  There is one other nutrient that we must have in large quantities:  water. Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two  hydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water. More than 60  percent of your total body weight is water. Without it, nothing could  be transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not  occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would  fluctuate widely. On average, an adult consumes just over two liters  of water per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so  critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and  output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in  Chapter 4. Micronutrients  Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser  amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions. Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins. There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See  Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2  “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their  major functions). In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins,  micronutrients are not sources of energy (calories), but they assist  in the process as cofactors or components of enzymes (i.e.,  coenzymes).\n",

            "Learning Objectives  By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:  •  Describe basic concepts in nutrition  •  Describe factors that affect your nutritional needs  •  Describe the importance of research and scientific  methods to understanding nutrition  What are Nutrients? The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances  required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must  be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not  synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three  basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure,  and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic  functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental  surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and  reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body  to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates,  lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain  non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common  in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or  beneficial (such as antioxidants). 4  |  Introduction\n",

For example, a deficiency in niacin causes a disease called  pellagra, which was common in the early twentieth century in some  parts of America. The common signs and symptoms of pellagra  are known as the “4D’s—diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death.” Until scientists found out that better diets relieved the signs and  symptoms of pellagra, many people with the disease ended up  hospitalized in insane asylums awaiting death. Other vitamins were  also found to prevent certain disorders and diseases such as scurvy  (vitamin C), night blindness vitamin A, and rickets (vitamin D).

            "Figure 1.1 The  Macronutrie nts:  Carbohydrat es, Lipids,  Protein, and  Water  Proteins  Proteins are macromolecules composed of chains of subunits called  amino acids. Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon,  oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include  meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant- based foods, most notably soy. The word protein comes from a  Greek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt  description of these macronutrients; they are also known  colloquially as the “workhorses” of life. Proteins provide four  kilocalories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not  protein’s most important function. Proteins provide structure to  bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the  chemical reactions that take place in the body. Scientists estimate  that greater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist  within the human body. The genetic codes in DNA are basically  protein recipes that determine the order in which 20 different  amino acids are bound together to make thousands of specific  proteins.

            "Dietary fiber is categorized as either water-soluble or insoluble. Some examples of soluble fibers are inulin, pectin, and guar gum  and they are found in peas, beans, oats, barley, and rye. Cellulose  and lignin are insoluble fibers and a few dietary sources of them  are whole-grain foods, flax, cauliflower, and avocados. Cellulose is  the most abundant fiber in plants, making up the cell walls and  providing structure. Soluble fibers are more easily accessible to  bacterial enzymes in the large intestine so they can be broken down  to a greater extent than insoluble fibers, but even some breakdown  of cellulose and other insoluble fibers occurs. The last class of fiber is functional fiber. Functional fibers have  been added to foods and have been shown to provide health  benefits to humans. Functional fibers may be extracted from plants  and purified or synthetically made. An example of a functional fiber  is psyllium-seed husk. Scientific studies show that consuming  psyllium-seed husk reduces blood-cholesterol levels and this health  claim has been approved by the FDA.\n",

It has many branches that  allow it to break down quickly when energy is needed by cells in the  body. It is predominantly found in liver and muscle tissue in animals. Dietary Fibers  Dietary fibers are polysaccharides that are highly branched and  cross-linked. Some dietary fibers are pectin, gums, cellulose,  hemicellulose, and lignin. Lignin, however, is not composed of  carbohydrate units. Humans do not produce the enzymes that can  break down dietary fiber; however, bacteria in the large intestine  (colon) do. Dietary fibers are very beneficial to our health. The  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee states that there is enough  scientific evidence to support that diets high in fiber reduce the  risk for obesity and diabetes, which are primary risk factors for  cardiovascular disease.2  2. US Department of Agriculture.\n",

(As  long as the juice is 100 percent fruit juice and only half your fruit  intake is replaced with juice, this is an acceptable exchange.)For  snacks, eat fruits, vegetables, or unsalted nuts. Fill a quarter of your plate with whole grains such as 100 percent  whole-grain cereals, breads, crackers, rice, and pasta. Half of your  daily grain intake should be whole grains. Read the ingredients list  on food labels carefully to determine if a food is comprised of whole  grains. Select a variety of protein foods to improve nutrient intake and  promote health benefits.
