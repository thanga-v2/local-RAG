It is also an enzyme cofactor essential for iron  absorption and transport. The other important function of copper  is as an antioxidant. It is naturally present in several foods and  is generally accessible as a dietary supplement.1 A typical adult  body has a total copper content of 50-120 mg.2 The body maintains  copper level balance through absorption from the intestine and the  release of copper by the liver into bile. 3 Current studies indicate  that copper deficiency may be more frequent than what was  previously discovered, while copper toxicity is rare due to  conventional diets. 4 Symptoms of mild to moderate copper  1.
