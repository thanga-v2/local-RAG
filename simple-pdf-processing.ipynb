PRE – TRIAL DECREE:-             If the suit is filed for fixing boundaries by the Court, then  appointment of advocate commissioner would serve purpose to decide the  real controversy between the parties but it is not even the case of the  petitioner that schedule property is not demarcated. In such case,  appointment of advocate commissioner is wholly unnecessary and it is  beyond the scope of the suit. The trial Court did not look into the reliefs  claimed in the suit; plea of the petitioner regarding survey of land and  fixation of boundary stones; and the purpose for which commissioner is  sought to be appointed. In those circumstances, the order passed by the  trial Court cannot be sustained as it amounts to granting pre-trial decree in  view of the law declared in Mohd.

Whether an appeal against an ad interim injunction is maintainable  under Order 43 Rule 1(r) C.P.C? HELD:- From the discussions made hereinbefore, there is no manner of  doubt that no appeal is maintainable in this Court under Order 43 Rule 1 of  C.P.C. and there cannot be any doubt that a revision petition shall be  maintainable. The same is referred in later judgment of single judge of this Court in  judgment cited (2003 (3) ALD 153) in support of his contention that the  revision is maintainable under Article 227 of Constitution, when the order  passed by the trial Court is illegal exercise of discretion. Article  227 of  Constitution  of  India  conferred  power  of  superintendence over all the Courts and tribunals throughout the  territories  in  relation  to  which  it  exercises  jurisdiction.  Under Article 227of Constitution the High Court can exercise  discretion when inferior courts assumes jurisdiction erroneously in  excess of power, when refuses to exercises jurisdiction, when  found an error of law apparent on the face of record, when  violated principles of natural justice, when inferior Court exercised  its authority arbitrarily or capriciously, when arrived any finding  perversely or based on no material or a patent or flagrant error in  procedure, when order resulting in manifest injustice. In the instant case, the order of the trial Court granting ex parte ad interim  injunction during pendency of the petition, however limiting the same to a  limited period is illegal exercise of discretion by the trial Court in flagrant  violation of settled principles of law in catena of judgments.

No injunction shall be granted to interdict the election when once  the election process is started. OBSERVED ; ''However in the judgment of Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernades and  Others v.Erasmo Jack de Sequeria (dead) through L.Rs , the Apex Court  in para No.86 held as follows: Grant or refusal of an injunction in a civil suit is the most  important stage in the civil trial. Due care, caution, diligence  and attention must be bestowed by the judicial officers and  judges while granting or refusing injunction. In most cases,  the fate of the case is decided by grant or refusal of an  injunction. Experience has shown that once an injunction is  granted, getting it vacated would become a nightmare for the  Defendant. In order to grant or refuse injunction, the judicial  officer or the judge must carefully examine the entire  pleadings  and  documents  with  utmost  care  and  seriousness.'' HELD:- The safe and better course is to give short notice on injunction  application and pass an appropriate order after hearing both the sides. In  case of grave urgency, if it becomes imperative to grant an exparte ad  interim injunction, it should be granted for a specified period, such as, for  two weeks. In those cases, the Plaintiff will have no inherent interest in  delaying disposal of injunction application after obtaining an exparte ad  interim injunction.

Filing of  memo is not contemplated either under Code of Civil Procedure or under  Civil Rules of Practice. The purpose of receiving memos by the Courts  is only to receive certain intimation pertaining to the lis pending  before it. Since filing of memo is not contemplated under Code of  Civil Procedure or Civil Rules of Practice, no judicial order can be  passed on memo. But the trial Court passed a judicial order based on  memo which is contrary to the established practice. Therefore, the order  passed by the trail Court basing on memo dated 11.09.2015 filed before  the trial Court is erroneous and it is an illegal exercise of jurisdiction which  is conferred on it. Pare 13. In view of my discussion in the earlier para, I am of the clear view  that no judicial order can be passed on memo. Accordingly, Point No.1 is  decided in favour of the respondents and against the petitioner. 2. Whether a document is admitted and marked as exhibit, it cannot  be questioned?

In M.Narasimhulus case (9th supra) single Judge of this Court  held that in view of bar underSection 36 once the document was admitted  in evidence, the same cannot be questioned, at subsequent stages, but in  view of law declared by Apex Court, the objection can be entertained to  determine judicially at any subsequent stage.'},\n",

In the first case,  merely because a document has been marked as 'an exhibit', an objection  as to its admissibility is not excluded and is available to be raised even at a  later stage or even in appeal or revision. In the latter case, the objection  should be taken before the evidence is tendered and once the document  has been admitted in evidence and marked as an exhibit, the objection that  it should not have been admitted in evidence or that the mode adopted for  proving the document is irregular cannot be allowed to be raised at any\"},\n",

The crucial test is whether an objection, if taken at the appropriate point of  time, would have enabled the party tendering the evidence to cure the  defect and resort to such mode of proof as would be regular. The omission  to object becomes fatal because by his failure the party entitled to object  allows the party tendering the evidence to act on an assumption that the  opposite party is not serious about the mode of proof. On the other hand, a  prompt objection does not prejudice the party tendering the evidence, for  two reasons: firstly, it enables the Court to apply its mind and pronounce  its decision on the question of admissibility then and there; and secondly,  in the event of finding of the Court on the mode of proof sought to be  adopted going against the party tendering the evidence, the opportunity of  seeking indulgence of the Court for permitting a regular mode or method of  proof and thereby removing the objection raised by the opposite party, is  available to the party leading the evidence. Such practice and procedure is  fair to both the parties. Out of the two types of objections, referred to  hereinabove, in the later case, failure to raise a prompt and timely  objection amounts to waiver of the necessity for insisting on formal proof of  a document, the document itself which is sought to be proved being  admissible in evidence.

Preventive detention is a serious invasion of personal  liberty and such meagre safeguards as the Constitution has  provided, against the improper exercise of the power, must  be zealously watched and enforced by the Court. (Ram  Krishan Bhardwaj v. State of Delhi ). Article 22(3)(b) of the  Constitution of India, which permits preventive detention, is  an exception to Article 21 of the Constitution. An exception  cannot, ordinarily, nullify the full force of the main rule, which  is the right to liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the  Constitution. An exception can apply only in rare cases. The  imposition of what is, in effect, a substantial term of  imprisonment by the exercise of executive discretion, without  trial, lies uneasily with the ordinary concept of the rule of law.

The Constitutional imperatives of  Article 22 (5), and the dual  obligation imposed on the authority making the order of  preventive detention, are twofold: (1) The detaining authority  must, as soon as may be, i.e. as soon as practicable, after the  detention order is passed, communicate to the detenu the  grounds on which the order of detention has been made, and (2)  the detaining authority must afford the detenu the earliest'},\n",

Section  25 of the Act confers power on the Court to secure payment of permanent  alimony, if necessary, by a charge of the immovable property of the  respondent. The said provision confers a discretion on the Court, and  enables exercise of the power to create a charge on immovable properties  if the Court considers it necessary to do so. HELD:-  It is no doubt true that gratuity, provident fund and other retiral benefits, are  not immovable property. Section 100 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882  (for short, 'the 1882 Act) enables a charge to be created on the immovable  property of one person by the act of parties, or by operation of law to  secure the payment of money to another. Section 25 of the Act, which  enables a charge to be created on immovable property, does not explicitly  provide for a charge being created on movable property. Ordinarily  conferment of power, by a specific statutory provision, is a pre-requisite for  its exercise. However, exceptional circumstances may justify exercise of  power in the absence of any statutory prohibition. In Durga Das v. Tara  Rani , after noting that the learned single judge had secured the payment  of permanent alimony, by a charge on the moveable and immovable  properties of the appellant, a Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana  High Court held that such a charge is inadmissible in so far as the  provident fund amount of the appellant is concerned, in view of Section  3 of the Provident Fund Act, 1925. The order of the learned single Judge  was modified by the Division Bench holding that the charge created, on the  movable and immovable property of the appellant, for securing the  permanent alimony allowed to the respondent, would not include his  provident fund amount. This modification by the Division Bench of the  Punjab and Haryana High Court, of the order of the Learned Single Judge,  was necessitated because of the statutory prohibition under Section 3 of  the Provident Fund Act, 1925.

It is a right to enter another\\'s land and to  take some profit of the soil, or a portion of the soil itself, for the  use of the owner of the right. The term \"profit a prendre\" is used  in contra- distinction to the term \"profit a rendre\" which signified a  benefit which has to be rendered by the possessor of the land  after it had come into his possession. A profit a prendre is a  servitude, and an interest in land, and for this reason any  disposition of it must be in writing. A profit a prendre, which gives  a right to participate in a portion only of some specified produce  of the land, is just as much an interest in the land as a right to  take the whole of that produce.

The distinction between a profit  a prendre and an easement is that while an easement only confers a right  to utilise the servient tenement in a particular manner, or to prevent the  commission of some act on that tenement, a profit a prendre confers a  right to take from the servient tenement some part of the soil of that  tenement or minerals under it or some part of its natural produce existing  upon it. What is taken must be capable of ownership, for otherwise the  right amounts to a mere easement. (Titaghur Paper Mills Co.

In N. Varalalakshmi Vs. N.V. Hanumantha Rao  , a Division Bench of this Court held that, even after a decree of divorce,  permanent alimony can be granted to the spouse who has applied for it  unless the conduct of the spouse is abominable; and that mere desertion  of the spouse would not amount to abominable conduct. It is only if the  conduct of the petitioner is abominable, would this Court be required to  consider whether, and to what extent, such conduct would have an effect  on the grant of permanent alimony. The word abominable means odious,'},\n",

The material  on record does show that the petitioner has made serious allegations  against her husband. She filed a criminal case against him for the offence  punishable underSection 498-A I.P.C. She also threatened to commit  suicide. While her conduct is not beyond reproach, is it such as to  disentitle her from being granted permanent alimony? Divorce is the termination of matrimonial relationship, and brings  to an end the status of a wife as such. On the status of a wife  being terminated, by a decree for divorce under the Hindu  Marriage Act, the rights of the divorced wife seem to be cribbed,  confined and cabined by the provisions of the Hindu Marriage  Act and to the rights available under Sections 25 and 27 of the  Act. (Kirtikant D. Vadodaria v. State of Gujarat ). Section 25 of the  Act confers power on the Court to secure payment of permanent  alimony, if necessary, by a charge of the immovable property of  the respondent. The said provision confers a discretion on the  Court, and enables exercise of the power to create a charge on  immovable properties if the Court considers it necessary to do so. 1.

Sannakka ,  held that a single creditor can maintain an insolvency petition  under Section 9 of the Act. In the said judgment, the single judge of this  Court relied on both Division Bench judgments of this Court and the  judgment of Division Bench of Madras High Court. 16. Learned counsel for respondent Nos.2 and 3 (appellants) drawn the  attention of this Court to the judgment of this Court in Pydimarri  Venkateswarlus case (supra 1), where the single judge of this Court held  that unless the creditor proved that the alienation was made to delay and  defeat the claims of general body of creditors, the debtor cannot be  adjudged as insolvent placing reliance on the judgment in Sanjeeva Reddy  v. Ellappa Reddy . Further, this Court, in a recent judgment in Gutta  Nirmalas case (supra 2) reiterated the same principle. But in both the  judgments, the Division Bench judgment of this Court in G.Ramachanders  case (supra 4) was not referred. Similarly, the judgment of the Madras  High Court was also not brought to the notice of this Court. Therefore,  these two judgments can be said to be per incurium. Hence, the principle  laid down in Gutta Nirmalas case (supra 2) is not a precedent, in view of  the Division Bench judgment of this Court. If the interpretation of the word'},\n",

A  perusal of language used under Sections 53, 54 and 54-A of the Act and  the mode of proof of debt under Part-III of the Act (From Sections  45 to 50), it is clear that before moving an insolvency Court to annul  transfer of property, a creditor has to satisfy the following conditions: 1) The debtor must be adjudged as insolvent. 2) The creditor should prove his debt by following the  procedure contemplated under Part-III of the Act 3) He should have made a request to the Official Receiver  for moving insolvency Court for annulling fraudulent  transaction and that the Official Receiver refused to move  such petition for annulment. 25. In the instant case, by the date of filing the petition, seeking annulment  under Section 53 or 54 of the Act, the petitioner was not even adjudged as  insolvent. So, the first condition was not satisfied. The petitioner did not  approach the Official Receiver and proved his debt as contemplated under  Part-III of the Act and complied Section 54-A of the Act. Thereby, the order  annulling the sale transaction covered by sale deeds dated 10.03.2004  vide document Nos.2605 of 2004 and 2606 of 2004 passed by the trial  Court as confirmed by the appellate Court, is erroneous ex facie and  contrary to provisions of Act.
